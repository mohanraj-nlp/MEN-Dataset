KUALA LUMPUR: At least RM3 billion of capital injection will be made available to assist public listed companies affected by Covid-19, Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz said.    In tabling the 2022 Budget today, Tengku Zafrul said the companies will have access to the additional funds through a government-owned special purpose vehicle (SPV) in the form of equity instruments or other related instruments. 'For this purpose, Khazanah Nasional Bhd will be given the mandate to assist the government in providing the infrastructure to administer a fund of at least RM3 billion,' he added. Since the beginning of the pandemic, scores of public listed companies across different sectors have been affected financially, and in market capitalisation. According to the Securities Commission Annual Report 2020, energy and utilities led the underperforming sectors, declining 18 per cent and 11.8 per cent year-on-year respectively in terms of market capitalisation. The regulator said the energy sector was pressured by volatile and significantly lower crude oil prices last year, averaging at US$43.3 per barrel compared to an average of US$64.2 per barrel in 2019, while the utilities sector was affected by lower commercial and industrial usage especially during the Movement Control Order (MCO) period. The other sectors recorded a decline, including property (-11.1 per cent), transportation and logistics (-10.1 per cent), construction (-6.0 per cent), plantation (-5.6 per cent), financial services (-1.2 per cent) and telecommunications and media (-0.7 per cent).
