{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR: The Malaysian Recycling Alliance (MAREA), which comprises the country's 10 leading fast-moving consumer goods companies, has targeted to recycle an initial 5,000 tonnes of plastic waste by year-end. Marea also pledged to reach a minimum recycling rate of 25 per cent or 20,000 tonnes of plastic waste of members' packaging volumes by 2025. Incorporated on January 4 last year, MAREA wants to bring about positive change by building awareness on the circular economy approach for more efficient packaging waste management. The 10 member companies comprise Coca-Cola Malaysia, Colgate-Palmolive Malaysia, Dutch Lady Milk Industries, Etika Group of Companies, Fraser & Neave Malaysia, Mondel\u0113z International (Malaysia), Nestl\u00e9 (Malaysia) Bhd, Spritzer, Tetra Pak Malaysia and Unilever Malaysia. Malaysia's first voluntary, not-for-profit, industry-driven extended producer responsibility (EPR) platform also aims to maximise the use of recycled and renewable materials among its members, promoting separation and collection at source while avoiding post-consumer packaging materials leakage into the environment. 'The collective commitments are part of MAREA's contribution to the nation's sustainable development with a strong emphasis and priority on plastic waste, in any form and shape, while triggering a positive spill-over effect throughout the value chain.' This was also in line with the Water and Environment Ministry's (KASA) Malaysia Plastic Sustainability Roadmap 2021-2030. MAREA has collaborated with the government and other stakeholders to jointly drive a common goal to improve collection and recycling rates for a greener, cleaner Malaysia and a more sustainable, waste-reduced future. MAREA chairman Juan Aranols said the alliance would work with policymakers, industry participants, consumers and other stakeholders to establish, expand and strengthen a circular value chain enabled by solid collection, sorting and recycling schemes. \u00a0'MAREA will cultivate a stronger recycling culture, initiating consumer education and public awareness campaigns to achieve large scale behaviour change and encourage people to adopt more sustainable lifestyles,' he said at a virtual briefing during the first anniversary celebration of MAREA yesterday. Environment and Water Minister Datuk Seri Tuan Ibrahim Tuan Man said the strategic thrust identified in the Plastics Sustainability Roadmap was to implement mandatory EPR initiatives and reach a recycling rate of 25 per cent for post-consumer plastic packaging by 2025. 'In line with this, we are heartened by MAREA's proactive pledge and voluntary initiatives, which are much aligned with our vision and goals. Through this dynamic multi-stakeholder approach, the Ministry believes that the results can strengthen the recycling circular economy, leading to a more sustainable future for all Malaysians,' he said. Housing and Local Government Deputy Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ismail Abd Muttalib said the minister would extend support to local authorities to drive positive socio-economic development, to ensure healthy and prosperous communities. 'Responsible management of waste is integral to this, and this is why we are working towards achieving the country's national recycling rate target. MAREA's launch is highly laudable, bringing together fast-moving-consumer-goods (FMCG) member companies that are eager to lead recycling initiatives with one unified goal,' he said. Aranols, who is Nestl\u00e9 Malaysia chief executive officer, said MAREA would want to reinforce the industry commitment to be an active contributor in the battle against packaging waste, specifically plastic packaging waste in any of its forms. He said Nestle Malaysia particularly, was excited to embark on the journey, which deemed as an investment for the future to bringing together all of the players with one common goal to solve the problem of plastic waste pollution, protecting oceans, shores and communities from its consequences. 'Environmental conservation is a key priority. We have to protect the planet's natural resources and preserve biodiversity and the ecosystems that support many of our communities. Plastic waste is an important environmental challenge and is a problem in Malaysia and across Southeast Asia,' he said."}
