{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 13 \u2015 Bursa Malaysia ended the morning trading session higher, driven by continued buying activities in selected heavyweights as investors remained positive over the economic outlook, dealers said. At 12.30pm, the benchmark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI (FBM KLCI) rose 3.45 points to 1,566.65 from yesterday's closing of 1,563.20. The index, which opened 1.24 points lower at 1,561.96, moved between 1,560.29 and 1,570.14 throughout the session.

Turnover stood at 1.98 billion units valued at RM921.15 million. In a note, Rakuten Trade said it expected the FBM KLCI to trend around the 1,560-1,570 today, supported by net foreign funds inflow. 'Yesterday's intermittent correction among banking stocks suggests that buying interests could return today, but market undertone remains cautious amidst the higher regional volatility,' it said. It said Wall Street ended in positive territory yesterday although the United States December inflation data came in sharply higher. 'Though the consumer price index (CPI) figure was largely within expectations, overall market sentiments remained rather cautious as the DJI Average gained a mere 38 points while Nasdaq was up 35 points to almost hitting the 15,190 mark. 'On the home front, last-minute buying activities helped pushed the index to close flat, having been in the red for most of yesterday's session,' it added.
