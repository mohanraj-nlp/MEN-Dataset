In a statement today, the property developer said the acquisition allowed it to grow its series of Sejati branded homes. \u00a0Paramount deputy group chief executive officer Benjamin Teo said the company had a solid reputation in Cyberjaya. 'We hope to replicate the success of these two developments and the timing couldn't be better. We are building on the strong momentum of Sejati Lakeside as we target to launch its final phase comprising three-storey lakefront semi-detached homes, in the fourth quarter of this year,' he added. \u00a0 Teo said development on the new land was expected to generate a gross development value (GDV) of RM319.8 million over six years.
