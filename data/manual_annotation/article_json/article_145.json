{"text": "KUCHING: Voters in the Pantai Damai state seat are eager to cast their votes today. Among them was Busri Ghazali, 67, who arrived at Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Tun Abang Haji Openg in Petra Jaya as early as 7.15am. In arriving early, he became the first voter to cast the vote, as soon as the polling centre opened at 7.30 am.  He said the voting process was smooth, despite the standard operating procedures being put in place.  'The polling centre workers were very accommodating, explaining to me the processes and guidelines,' he said when met today.  Busri said he came early as his wife will be casting her vote at a different polling centre.  'I will have to send her after this,' he said.  There are a total of 20,474 voters set to cast their votes for the Pantai Damai state seat. The state seat is seeing a straight fight between Gabungan Parti Sarawak candidate Datuk Dr Abdul Rahman Junaidi and Parti Sarawak Bersatu candidate Mahmud Sabli. Rahman, who is the Parti Pesaka Bumiputera Bersatu (PBB) vice president, won the state seat under the Barisan Nasional (BN) ticket with 3,315 majority votes in the 2001 Sarawak Election.  He then defended the seat in the 2006, 2011 and 2016 state polls."}
