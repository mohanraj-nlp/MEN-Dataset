{"text": "KOTA KINABALU: The Sabah Commercial Vehicle Licensing Board (CVLB) has already told the management of Kinabalu International Airport (KKIA) to provide a waiting area for e-hailing drivers last year.   Its chairman Datuk Chin Kim Hiung said a letter was sent on Dec 23 to the management with proposals to reduce traffic congestion and waiting time at the airport.   'If the proposals were to be implemented, it will provide a waiting area for e-hailing drivers to send and pick-up passengers who have made their bookings.     'The management of e-hailing rides will be more organised and easier for passengers without disrupting the traffic flow,' said Chin.   He was responding to calls by KKIA Limousine and Taxi Association chairman Shamsuddin Mohd Shah for him to resign yesterday for failing to address the issue at the airport.   On geo-fencing to be set up at KKIA, Chin said a meeting was held on Dec 10 last year, where the e-hailing operator (eHO) had informed that it had been implemented for drivers.   The meeting, chaired by Sabah CVLB director Norsiah Patah, was attended by representatives of Malaysia Airports Sdn Bhd in Kota Kinabalu, Tawau, Lahad Datu and Sandakan.   On another issue, he said the Sabah CVLB would conduct a thorough study first before allowing city taxi drivers to operate at KKIA.   'Any decision made will take into account the welfare and interests of all parties involved."}
