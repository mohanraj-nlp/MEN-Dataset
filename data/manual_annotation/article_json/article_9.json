{"text": "KUCHING: The crushing defeat of DAP and PKR in the state election proves that people in Sarawak want a local-based party to lead its government, that is Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS). Its chairman Tan Sri Abang Johari Openg, in his victory speech, said the outcome of the polls was a clear sign that the people wanted political stability to continue development in the state. '(The people) have said that Sarawak is better looked after by Sarawakians. 'With this mandate, it will also give GPS the push to continue with implementing its sustainable economic development agenda and social policies that are people-centric,' he said. Abang Johari said he was in 'no hurry' to form his cabinet, as he had good partners within the coalition. 'When the time comes, I will announce my cabinet.' Elaborating on the outcome of today's polls, Abang Johari is upbeat that GPS can secure two-thirds majority, enabling the state-based coalition to form a stronger Sarawak administration. As at 9.30pm, GPS had won 58 seats, three seats more than the two-thirds majority mark. Parti Sarawak Bersatu (PSB) and DAP won two seats each."}
