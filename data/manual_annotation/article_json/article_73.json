{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Frontken Corp Bhd's net profit increased 28 per cent year-on-year (YoY) to RM27.30 million in the third quarter (Q3) ended September 30, 2021, from RM21.34 million recorded previously. In an exchange filing today, the surface engineering service provider said this was mainly contributed by improved revenue, strict cost management and continual enhancement of our processes, leading to better production efficiency. Its Q3 revenue rose per cent YoY to RM116.60 million from RM94.80 million on the back of significant contributions by the company's subsidiaries in Taiwan and Malaysia, supported by the strong demand and new orders for the provision of manpower supply and mechanical rotating equipment services. For the first nine-month period, Frontken's net profit expanded 27.7 per cent to RM74.96 million from RM58.68 million, while revenue grew 23 per cent YoY to RM328.74 million from RM267.28 million. Frontken said higher demand and firm orders from customers on advanced node chips benefited the company's semiconductor business. 'The customer has announced earlier this year their plans to invest US$100 billion over the next three years to ramp up production.' The global semiconductor market is expected to grow to US$551 billion (RM2.29 trillion) in 2021, up from its previous forecast of US$527.7 billion (RM2.19 trillion), according to World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS). The global semiconductor market is expected to grow 25.1 per cent this year. Frontken said the strong demand for its customer's industry-leading technology advance nodes chips and their significant investment for capacity expansion would support Frontken's business growth in years to come. 'This has led us to the decision also to expand our production capacity. As a result, we recently announced the purchase of a new facility in Kaoshiung, Taiwan, which we expect to be commissioned sometime during the second half of 2022.' Meanwhile, the company has noticed a robust improvement in the oil and gas industry, reflecting in its new orders trickling in from the various umbrella contracts for the provision of manpower supply and mechanical rotating equipment services and parts with the Petronas group of companies. 'We hope the momentum will pick up further in the fourth quarter of this year and throughout 2022, where our soon to be completed new facility in Pengerang will be ready to support the contracts we have with our customers.' Frontken is cautiously optimistic that its performance for the remaining months in 2021 would likely be satisfactory amid the encouraging business developments."}
