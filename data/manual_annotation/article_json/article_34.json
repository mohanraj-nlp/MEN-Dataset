{"text": "KUALA KRAI: The Kampung Jirat bridge which was submerged in floodwaters on Saturday, is now open to motorists. District police chief Superintendent Suzaimi Mohamad said motorists could use the bridge since this morning after the floodwaters receded last night. 'The bridge has been inundated for more than three days and it is now available for villagers. 'But they must be careful when passing the wooden bridge,' he added. Suzaimi said Saturday's incident did not completely cut-off links to the village as there were other alternative roads. He added the bridge was also seldom used by villagers. 'Kampung Jirat bridge is located in a low-lying area and is regularly submerged by floodwaters when monsoon season arrives,' he added. He said the flood situation in the district was still under control as lesser rain hit the state since yesterday."}
