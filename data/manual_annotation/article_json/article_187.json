{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 23 \u2014 The ringgit declined\u00a0further against\u00a0the US dollar at the opening bell today, following the United States\u00a0Federal Reserve's (US Fed)\u00a0upbeat conclusion of\u00a0the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting yesterday,\u00a0which could lead to an\u00a0eventual hike in their policy rate, said an analyst.\u00a0 At 9am, the local note depreciated to 4.1925/1955 from\u00a04.1910/1950 at Wednesday's close. Bank Islam chief economist Dr Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid said the FOMC meeting was concluded\u00a0with the US Fed explicitly stating\u00a0its intention to taper down its\u00a0asset purchase\u00a0programme soon. \"The FOMC members were of the view that the US economy has made good progress towards achieving its dual policy goals, including\u00a0maximum employment and price stability,' he told Bernama.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0More importantly, he said\u00a0the US Fed's dot plots indicated that more participants were\u00a0expecting higher interest rates next year,\u00a0where\u00a0the Fund Rate could be higher than 0.25 per cent\u00a0in 2022. \"The survey among the US Fed's members was also in line\u00a0with the economic projection as the US' 2022 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) forecast has been bumped up to 3.8 per cent\u00a0from 3.3 per cent\u00a0projected in\u00a0June,' he said. Mohd Afzanizam\u00a0noted that the inflation rate\u00a0projection\u00a0was also revised upwards up to\u00a02023, implying that the rate hike cycle would begin\u00a0in 2022. Consequently,\u00a0the greenback is also strengthening against major currencies, he added. \"As such, the ringgit could stay weaker today,' he said.\u00a0 Similarly,\u00a0ActivTrades trader Dyogenes Rodrigues Diniz said the\u00a0scenario could cause the local note\u00a0to slip over the next few days to the 4.2400 level, where it may encounter some selling pressure.\u00a0 'Apart from that, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is due tomorrow, could bring some volatility to the market.\u00a0 'If the CPI comes in below expectations, it could cause the ringgit to lose more value against the US dollar,' he said. At the opening, the ringgit was traded\u00a0higher\u00a0against a basket of major currencies. The ringgit increased\u00a0versus the British pound to 5.7085/7126\u00a0from 5.7140/7195\u00a0at Wednesday's close, climbed\u00a0vis-a-vis\u00a0the Singapore dollar to 3.0948/0972\u00a0from 3.0996/1028 and appreciated\u00a0to 4.8998/9033\u00a0versus the euro from 4.9156/9203\u00a0yesterday. The local note also widened against the yen\u00a0to\u00a03.8162/8193 from 3.8270/8311 previously"}
