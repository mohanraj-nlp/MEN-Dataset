{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Cuepacs has called out people who blamed the civil servants for the delay in helping flood victims in the Klang Valley.  Its president Datuk Adnan Mat said it was a baseless accusation as the civil servants had to follow the standard operating procedures, while the extraordinary flood this time around made it harder to execute rescue efforts.   He said the rescue operations were also made difficult with some of the victims refusing to be relocated to safety during the early period of the floods.  'Over 300 security personnel homes were also flooded and they had to leave their homes and their own family to go out to rescue other victims.  'There are also personnel who were stranded at their homes due to the floods.  'The shortcomings in rescue efforts should not be solely placed on them,' he said in a statement today.  Several states including Selangor, Kelantan and Pahang experienced massive floods last week which displaced tens of thousands from their homes. Cuepacs also urged the government to pay attention towards providing sufficient new assets to be used during rescue operations.  'Complete and suitable assets and equipment will enable rescue work to be carried out more effectively without inviting risk to the search and rescue (SAR) members themselves.' he said. Similarly, the number of SAR personnel is insufficient  and the government has yet to give approval for additional manpower, he added.  Adnan pointed out that the current SAR members could not deployed at all locations in Klang Valley.  'Cuepacs hopes all parties would support the security forces in the country.  'Our focus now is to be ready to face flood and post-flood scenarios.  'Correct the misconceptions and let us continue to channel aid in our own ways. 'At least let us not continue to complicate the task of the security forces with these baseless allegations,' he added."}
