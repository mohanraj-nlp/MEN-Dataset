KUALA LUMPUR: The last-minute inclusion of midfielder Azfar Fikri Azhar for the national youth side paid off when he earned Malaysia their second win in the AFC Under-23 qualifiers in Mongolia today.    Terengganu II player Azfar was only called up less than a week - to replace an injured Ahmad Aysar Hadi Shapri of JDT II - before the team departed for Ulaanbaatar on Oct 20.   Azfar, who scored in Malaysia's 1-0 win over Laos on Monday, struck again against Mongolia at the MFF Football Centre.    He hit the winner in the 40th minute, following an assist from Terengganu II teammate, Hairiey Hakim Mamat.   Malaysia now lead Group G with six points. The 11 group winners and the four best runners-up will qualify for the AFC U-23 Asian Cup in Uzbekistan next year.
