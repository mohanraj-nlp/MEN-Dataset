KUALA LUMPUR: All Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad (KTMB) passenger commuter train services from the Batu Tiga station to the Port Klang station and vice versa are suspended due to floods and landslides between the Padang Jawa and Shah Alam sectors.  All cargo train services from Port Klang will also be suspended temporarily until the flood water level at the Batu Tiga station recedes and tracks in the Padang Jawa and Shah Alam sectors recover.  KTMB Chief Operating Officer Mohd Zain Mat Taha in a statement said for the Port Klang - Tanjung Malim - Port Klang KTM Komuter service, trains from KL Sentral to Port Klang will end at the Subang Jaya station and turn back to KL Sentral.  Affected passengers can get a full fare refund or change their travel date via the KITS e-wallet or at the counters according to the terms and conditions.  Heavy rain since yesterday has also affected several passenger train service operations in the East Coast and Klang Valley sectors due to the floods. He said strong winds had caused trees to fall and damaged overhead line equipment, with tracks flooded in some places causing delays as well as train cancellations.  'KTMB had to cancel some train services for the safety of passengers. Therefore, we apologise for the inconvenience,' said Mohd Zain.  Meanwhile, all ETS services will operate as usual and the KTM Intercity Ekspres Rakyat Timuran service, train services number 26 and 27 of the Kempas Baru route will operate as usual.  Any latest developments will be informed from time to time, he said.
