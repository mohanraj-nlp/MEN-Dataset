KUALA LUMPUR: PLUS Malaysia Bhd says it has recorded an encouraging migration rate of 10 per cent radio-frequency identification (RFID) transactions after its implementation across the entire North-South Expressway on Jan 15. PLUS' announcement followed reports that the system had received backlash from the public over massive traffic congestion at certain toll booths on Monday. The highway operator, in a statement today, said it appreciated the feedback and public's views on the congestion issue that arose at the toll plazas and were making improvements based on the feedbacks. PLUS said it had doubled up the teams to assist customers at the toll plazas, as well as improving the visibility of directional signages to increase familiarity of RFID lanes. 'Highway customers are advised to ensure proper use of the lanes according to the guidance on the signage provided. Highway customers who experience detection issues at the RFID lane need not worry as toll personnel will be on hand with a handheld device to scan the RFID tag. 'Should the tag still remain undetectable, a coupon for a full detection diagnostic at the nearest Touch 'n Go fitment centre will be provided. If the RFID tag still have detection issues after the test, Touch 'n Go will replace the RFID tag for free,' it said in a statement today. Yesterday, Works Minister Datuk Seri Fadillah Yusof directed PLUS to find a solution to the congestion issue. 'I have contacted them (PLUS and TnG) after receiving complaints, and I have asked them to explain to the public and come out with a solution (to the problem) arising from the implementation of RFID. 'When it is a pioneering project, it will face certain issues that need to be solved,' he was quoted as saying after observing the opening of the Dengkil Bridge at FT31 (Jalan Banting Semenyih) on Monday.
