KLUANG: A non-governmental organisation recently donated 40 hampers to students at SMK Canossian Convent here.  Perkhidmatan Komuniti Sempurna (PKS) youth director Peter Soo said this was its final corporate social responsibility project for 2021, which was carried forward into the new year.    'This was supposed to be a Christmas project but it was delayed due to the postponement of the reopening of school from Jan 2 to Jan 9.   PKS has been actively involved in humanitarian efforts in the past two years of the pandemic.   'We are concerned about the welfare of the community and giving food items is a practical way of helping the students' families.   'We also had projects for the school last year during Chinese New Year, Hari Raya and Deepavali,' said Soo, who is also a committee member of the school's parent-teacher association.
