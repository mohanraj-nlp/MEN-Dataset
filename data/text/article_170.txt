KUALA LUMPUR: AirAsia Group Bhd has renamed the holding company of its airline operations to AirAsia Aviation Ltd as the low cost carrier undertakes a rapid transformation from an airline into a digital travel and lifestyle services. AirAsia Group, in a statement today, said Bo Lingam would take over as group chief executive officer of AirAsia Aviation, overseeing its four airlines (AirAsia Malaysia, AirAsia Philippines,  AirAsia Thailand and AirAsia Indonesia).  AirAsia Group is the investment holding company for the eight digital portfolio companies that leverage data and technology to deliver the best value at the lowest cost.   Its comprehensive portfolio includes AirAsia Aviation, the airasia Super App, cargo and logistics venture Teleport, BigPay financial services, the edutech arm AirAsia Academy, engineering company Asia Digital Engineering, ground services division GTR and the restaurant chain and food group called Santan.  Lingam said the structural change would facilitate strong projected growth in both airline and non-airline portfolio businesses. 'The AirAsia Aviation entity holds our existing airline investments and paves the way for new airline ventures to be formed in due course.  'We have also established a new AirAsia Consulting division tasked at reviewing new airline partnerships and franchise opportunities,' he said. Lingam said the creation of airline holding company would allow the group to focus on continuing to be the world's best low cost airline.  'We have spent the past 18 months reviewing every aspect of the operation to ensure that our airlines will return stronger than ever before.  'The world is finally opening up and we foresee a V-shaped rebound in air travel in the near future.  In Malaysia, we are already seeing huge pent up demand for air travel since the government's recent announcement of the resumption of interstate travel on October 11.' AirAsia Malaysia operates over 60 daily flights to 16 key leisure destinations and more frequencies and routes will continue to be added in response to significant consumer demand. Lingam said pleasing progress was underway in its other airlines in Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines as services began to resume in line with accelerated vaccination rates and the easing of travel restrictions in its key markets. 'We look forward to the opening of international borders as the next key milestone. We will continue to review new markets to operate from in the future, like Cambodia for example, when we can connect Asean once again with the best value fares and lifestyle offerings,' he added.
