The National Juniors will resume their quarantine-style training programme today at the Academy Badminton Malaysia (ABM) in Bukit Kiara.   The juniors will be the first on court again after six seniors tested positive for Covid-19 last week.   BAM secretary general Datuk Kenny Goh said none of the junior players or coaches came into direct contact with the six, who are now quarantined at  Malaysia Agro Exposition Park Serdang (MAEPS).   'We have decided that the juniors will resume training first on Wednesday, and we will monitor them day to day.   'As for the seniors, their training programme has been put on hold for the time being.'   It is learnt that the senior players and coaches, currently in self isolation, will   be tested again on Friday.   A total of 91 athletes, coaches and officials at the ABM were tested last week, and their results were negative.   Kenny said BAM are still waiting to hear from the doctors at MAEPS as to when the six players can rejoin national training.    'We have yet to hear anything from MAEPS, but once we get clearance, they should be back,' he added.   The backup players and 10 juniors will fly to Europe next for the Slovenia International Series on May 19-22 and the Austrian Open on May 27-30.
