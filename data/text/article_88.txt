KUALA LUMPUR: George Kent (Malaysia) Bhd posted a net profit of RM133,000 in the second quarter (Q2) ended September 30, 2021. Its revenue stood at RM79.7 million for Q2 2021, George Kent said in a statement today. For the six-month period, the company registered a net profit of RM11.93 million on a revenue of RM140.97 million. George Kent said it continued operations performed creditably despite the disruptions brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic. 'Contribution from these continuing businesses were on par with the preceding quarter. However, net profit was impacted by the recognition of a one-off impairment of RM9.85 million from the disposal of the investment in MRCB George Kent Sdn Bhd, which is not tax-deductible,' it said. George Kent said the results reflected the robustness of its metering business. Despite the various iterations of the Movement Control Order (MCO) implemented domestically and the global lockdowns in most countries due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, the company said orders for its water meters were largely uninterrupted. 'However, temporary suspension of operations and limitation in the workforce due to the MCO had affected our production ability to meet demands for our meters and slowed the site progress of our construction projects. After the temporary suspension, the production capacity was at 60 per cent,' it added. George Kent declared an interim dividend of 1.0 sen per share for the financial year 2022, payable on December 29 this year. Commenting on its prospects, chairman Tan Sri Tan Kay Hock said the company remained relevant and competitive. Tan said the company's investment in technology would be one of its innovative tools to digitalise its existing businesses and generate new business ventures over the long term. 'This will help solidify our future growth potential, thereby ensuring continued growth in shareholder returns as George Kent has delivered over decades,' he said.
