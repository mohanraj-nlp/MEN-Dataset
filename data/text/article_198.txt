AMID  the Covid-19 pandemic, BAM are expected to ink a new sponsorship deal with sports equipment company, Yonex, this week.    This will bring an end to the present six-year contract, worth RM60 million with Victor, signed in 2015.    Prior to the partnership with Victor, BAM were with Yonex for 15 years.    A source told Timesport yesterday that the new deal comes at a crucial time, with the pandemic having crippled sports around the world over the past one year.   'It's definitely helpful, given the current climate. This is good news for everybody.'   The new sponsorship deal will come as a huge boost to BAM as they prepare for the Tokyo Olympics.   This would also mean that Yonex will be the title sponsor for the Malaysia Open on May 25-30. BAM's other major sponsor is Celcom Axiata.
