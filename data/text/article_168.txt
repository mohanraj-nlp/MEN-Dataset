KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 12 â€• Bursa Malaysia is expected to continue its uptrend next week on improved sentiment despite regional market volatility, an analyst said. Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd vice-president of equity research Thong Pak Leng said the benchmark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI (FBM KLCI) is expected to move in the 1,570 to 1,585 range. 'From a technical point of view, immediate resistance is unchanged at 1,600 while support is at 1,570,' he told Bernama. FBM KLCI ended the week with a third consecutive intraday high, supported by growing buying interest and bargain-hunting activities. On Friday, the benchmark index advanced by 0.56 per cent, or 8.79 points, to close at 1,578.89, lifted mainly by banking, plantation and telecommunication counters. The Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM) yesterday announced that Malaysia's economy grew by 3.6 per cent in the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2021, driven by the recovery in domestic demand following the resumption of economic activities. It said that overall, Malaysia's economic performance in 2021 revealed a recovery momentum with a growth of 3.1 per cent, compared to a decline of 5.6 per cent in 2020. Thong said the gross domestic product (GDP) data came in below expectations, but the prospect of the reopening of borders will be positive for other sectors. 'We expect that the economic performance in the first quarter of 2022 should be much better,' said Thong. For the week just ended, Bursa Malaysia trended mostly higher on improved sentiment and increased buying interest despite heightened market volatility in the region.
