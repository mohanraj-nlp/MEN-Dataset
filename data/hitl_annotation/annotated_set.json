[{"id": "article_201", "text": "MIRI, Dec 23  The Democratic Action Party (DAP) must initiate reforms if it seeks to remain relevant in Sarawak, said DAP Socialist Youth (Dapsy) Sarawak chief Peter Hee. In a statement, he said if DAP is committed to go further and remain formidable, the party must be ready to bounce back stronger for the people of Sarawak. He pointed out DAP is now competing with many local-based opposition parties. 'It is different decades or just five years ago when DAP was seen as the only opposition in Sarawak. The results of PRN 12 (12th state election) spoke clearly and we must respond proactively. 'The aspirations of Sarawakians are to take over the GPS (Gabungan Parti Sarawak) government one day and the next step is to see if the new state government can go for more autonomous governance or even independence if circumstances are matured and people are ready; it is a step-by-step progressive political movement,' he claimed. He was clarifying his earlier statement on the need to set up a Sarawak-based youth party. 'I wish to reiterate that it remains my personal and honest opinion taking into account the sentiment and tendency of voting pattern, especially the youth voters in the just concluded PRN-12,' he said. Hee claimed his thoughts sought to provoke brainstorming and much-needed healthy discussion so that DAP Sarawak could reposition in the face of future challenges, with a new political landscape, different scenarios, according to the direction of voters in Sarawak. 'I believe every generation has its own mission and as we grow or move forward, we must be ready to adapt to changing political aspirations of the people. More so when Sarawak has its own dynamic factors, like Sabah's, due to decades long suffering and unfair treatment in the federation. 'There are few possible steps to be initiated in reshaping the party, and my humble expression which was from the bottom of my heart for localising the party is only one of those options, it is not absolute and final,' Hee said. He claimed DAP has other options available and that he has full faith the party's leadership would exercise wisdom for the betterment of the party. 'If my thoughts hurt and offended feelings and were unwelcome by many, I wish to sincerely apologise for my unintentional blunder,' he said. 'If we are from the people, for the people, then by speaking out the voices of the people shall be encouraged.' DAP stood in 26 constituencies in the 12th state election but won just two seats.", "entities": [{"id": 1, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}}, {"id": 2, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 41}}, {"id": 3, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 43, "end_offset": 46}}, {"id": 4, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 104, "end_offset": 111}}, {"id": 5, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 118, "end_offset": 137}}, {"id": 6, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 160, "end_offset": 169}}, {"id": 7, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 198, "end_offset": 201}}, {"id": 8, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 318, "end_offset": 325}}, {"id": 9, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 342, "end_offset": 345}}, {"id": 10, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 458, "end_offset": 461}}, {"id": 11, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 497, "end_offset": 504}}, {"id": 12, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 521, "end_offset": 527}}, {"id": 13, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 529, "end_offset": 548}}, {"id": 14, "label": "NORP", "position": {"start_offset": 617, "end_offset": 628}}, {"id": 15, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 650, "end_offset": 653}}, {"id": 16, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 655, "end_offset": 677}}, {"id": 17, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 994, "end_offset": 1001}}, {"id": 18, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1223, "end_offset": 1226}}, {"id": 19, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1323, "end_offset": 1334}}, {"id": 20, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1479, "end_offset": 1486}}, {"id": 21, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1656, "end_offset": 1663}}, {"id": 22, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1698, "end_offset": 1703}}, {"id": 23, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1996, "end_offset": 1999}}, {"id": 24, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 2017, "end_offset": 2020}}, {"id": 25, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 2407, "end_offset": 2410}}, {"id": 26, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 2445, "end_offset": 2464}}, {"id": 27, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 146, "end_offset": 153}}, {"id": 28, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 154, "end_offset": 159}}, {"id": 29, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 139, "end_offset": 144}}, {"id": 30, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 1205, "end_offset": 1211}}, {"id": 31, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 154, "end_offset": 165}}, {"id": 32, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 146, "end_offset": 165}}, {"id": 33, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 118, "end_offset": 165}}], "relations": [{"id": 250, "head": 13, "tail": 11, "relation": "location", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 240, "head": 1, "tail": 4, "relation": "Part-Whole.Geo", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 241, "head": 2, "tail": 3, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 242, "head": 5, "tail": 29, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 244, "head": 32, "tail": 5, "relation": "director / manager", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 245, "head": 32, "tail": 29, "relation": "director / manager", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 246, "head": 31, "tail": 27, "relation": "Physical.Located", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 247, "head": 12, "tail": 13, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 248, "head": 14, "tail": 11, "relation": "Gen-Aff.CRRE", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 249, "head": 15, "tail": 16, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 251, "head": 12, "tail": 11, "relation": "location", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 243, "head": 6, "tail": 28, "relation": "occupation", "relation_source": "DocRED"}]}, {"id": "article_202", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 19  CIMB Group Bhd is expecting its loans growth in 2022 to exceed the growth in 2021. However, loans growth for Thailand and Indonesia is expected to be below the industry rate in the first half of 2022 (1H22) due to the recalibration of the bank's financing portfolio in the two countries, said AmInvestment Bank in a note today. Nevertheless, it has maintained its 'buy' call on CIMB, with an unchanged fair value of RM6.20 per share based on financial year 2022's (FY22) return on equity (ROE) of 9.8 per cent, noting that foreign shareholdings of the stock rose to 24.7 per cent in December 2021 versus a low of 20.3 per cent in May 2021. Meanwhile, it foresees no significant increase in management overlays from CIMB's loan repayment assistance programme (URUS). It said conservative provisions have already been set aside via top-ups of management overlays in FY20 and FY21, while the group now has better visibility on the risk segments of its loan book. 'We understand that applications for URUS have risen since November 2021, however, the total amount of loans where borrowers have applied for URUS on an absolute value basis has so far been insignificant; below 1.0 per cent of Malaysia's total consumer loans. 'Management alluded to a potential pick-up in applications for URUS towards the end of the deadline (Jan 31, 2022). Nevertheless, we do not anticipate a sharp rise in applications for URUS due to the stricter qualifying criteria on borrowers,' AmInvestment said. RHB Research has also maintained its 'buy' call on CIMB, raising its target price by 14.3 per cent to RM6.30, premised on its expectation that the share price would trend higher on healthy earnings growth in FY22-23 and still decent valuation. 'Although asset quality remains stable, credit cost is expected to stay elevated in the fourth quarter of 2021. 'This is due to further management overlays for URUS, a refresh of macroeconomic factors in the expected credit loss, additional provisions for corporate accounts in Malaysia and Indonesia, and accelerated run-down of its Thai commercial book,' it said in a research note today. Conversely, in a separate note, MIDF Research has downgraded its call on the bank to 'neutral' as it opined that CIMB has a number of headwinds in the short term, most notably a high gross impaired loan ratio, heavy provisions and weak loan growth. Nevertheless, it noted that the bank's long-term prospects remain intact  higher ROE and return on capital employed as result of its kitchen-sinking exercise, a streamlined loan portfolio following its current restructuring, and heavy exposure to the regional market.", "entities": [{"id": 34, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 12}}, {"id": 35, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 36}}, {"id": 36, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 131, "end_offset": 139}}, {"id": 37, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 144, "end_offset": 153}}, {"id": 38, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 315, "end_offset": 332}}, {"id": 39, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 400, "end_offset": 404}}, {"id": 40, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 737, "end_offset": 741}}, {"id": 41, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1209, "end_offset": 1217}}, {"id": 42, "label": "PRODUCT", "position": {"start_offset": 1305, "end_offset": 1309}}, {"id": 43, "label": "PRODUCT", "position": {"start_offset": 1426, "end_offset": 1430}}, {"id": 44, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1486, "end_offset": 1498}}, {"id": 45, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1505, "end_offset": 1517}}, {"id": 46, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1556, "end_offset": 1560}}, {"id": 47, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 2027, "end_offset": 2035}}, {"id": 48, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 2040, "end_offset": 2049}}, {"id": 49, "label": "NORP", "position": {"start_offset": 2083, "end_offset": 2087}}, {"id": 50, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 2172, "end_offset": 2185}}, {"id": 51, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 2253, "end_offset": 2257}}, {"id": 52, "label": "PRODUCT", "position": {"start_offset": 1124, "end_offset": 1128}}, {"id": 53, "label": "PRODUCT", "position": {"start_offset": 781, "end_offset": 785}}, {"id": 54, "label": "PRODUCT", "position": {"start_offset": 1909, "end_offset": 1913}}], "relations": [{"id": 236, "head": 40, "tail": 53, "relation": "intended public", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 237, "head": 34, "tail": 47, "relation": "capital of", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 238, "head": 49, "tail": 36, "relation": "Gen-Aff.CRRE", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 239, "head": 38, "tail": 34, "relation": "location", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 234, "head": 35, "tail": 34, "relation": "location", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 235, "head": 35, "tail": 39, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1591, "head": 36, "tail": 49, "relation": "country of citizenship", "relation_source": "DocRED"}]}, {"id": "article_203", "text": "KOTA KINABALU: Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS) has been having unofficial meetings on its formalisation, said Sabah Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu) deputy chief Datuk Seri Masidi Manjun.

When asked whether other component party leaders were keen to register the coalition, Masidi said he could not say due to the respective party's stance but said some leaders were eager with the idea. Among those who voiced out about the issue were Bersatu Information chief Khairul Firdaus Akbar and Sabah Armada Chief Fairuz Renddan. Khairul had said that the existing leadership under the GRS government would be able to bring Sabah to the pinnacle of success. He had also added that the never-ending political situation in Peninsular Malaysia should prompt Sabah leaders to chart a direction based on the interests of Sabahans.

Cheng Hoe was impressed with the Angkor Warriors who defeated Guam 3-1 on aggregate in an Asian Cup qualifier last month.   'Cambodia are playing well under coach Ryu Hirose with the guidance of team manager Keisuke Honda. They are improving fast as a team, so it will not be so easy for us,' said Cheng Hoe.

'I do not want our players to be overconfident in the opening AFF Cup match.  'They have to focus on playing to instructions.     'They have several top players who ply their trade abroad.

Ceres Arena. This was Indonesia's 20th appearance in a Thomas Cup final and a record-extending 14th crown.  They achieved their last win in 2002 in Guanzhou when they defeated Malaysia 3-2. World No 5 Anthony Sinisuka Ginting survived a tense opening match to outlast world No 27 Lu Guang Zu 18-21, 21-14, 21-16 in 77 minutes to give Indonesia the lead. Guang Zu had replaced top-ranked Shi Yu Qi, who suffered an injury in the semi-finals against Japan on Saturday. 'Today's match against Guang Zu was the toughest in three meetings. However, I knew he would be pressing hard for a win, but I was calm throughout the match,' Anthony told Bernama on Sunday. Seventh-ranked Fajar Alfian-Muhammad Rian Ardianto showed their class in the next match, beating He Ji Ting-Zhou Hao Dong 21-12, 21-19 to double Indonesia's lead in front of 2,000 spectators. Indonesia clinched their winning point when World No 7 Jonatan Christie defeated 65th-ranked Li Shifeng 21-14, 18-21, 21-14.  'Winning the Thomas Cup is my biggest achievement, bigger than my Asian Games gold medal,' Jonatan told the Badminton World Federation.  Although veteran Hendra Setiawan did not play in the final, it was a meaningful outing for the Indonesian captain, who had never won the Thomas Cup throughout his illustrious career. However, the celebration on stage was a subdued affair for Indonesia as there was no hoisting of their red and white flag despite the national anthem being played. It is because of a sanctioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency for being non-compliant with the anti-doping code.  The Indonesian Badminton Association (PBSI) flag was instead raised during the victory ceremony", "entities": [{"id": 249, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 6}},

Sunway Group founder and chairman Tan Sri Dr Jeffrey Cheah said the country's economy, which had been badly affected by Covid-19, needed extraordinary initiatives especially in 2022 Budget. Cheah said the policies needed to be very different from the old, taking into consideration the suffering of the rakyat. 'We need policies that will encourage business and also bring back confidence in the government institution. The government needs to get people to really come out united as one to bring prosperity into the country's economic system,' he said at the virtual Merdeka and Malaysia Day edition of MIDF Conversations today. Cheah said the government also needed to relook at its Malaysia My Second Home (MM2H) policy, considering an improvement to the programme as a strategy to assist in the country's recovery. 'To me, (changes to the) MM2H now is very demotivating. Instead of giving incentives, they are adding more hurdles to the foreigners. These people have brought in billions of ringgit to the country as they bring in tourists. 'We can easily capture a lot of cash on this tourism with these people bringing their families and friends to visit Malaysia. Why does the government want to change this policy? 'Luckily, now the minister said they will relook at it. I hope that the government will put their full commitment on this matter, but if they don't, it is going to be wasted,' he said. On August 11, the government said the MM2H would be reactivated with nine new conditions after the programme was suspended in August last year in view of the global Covid-19 pandemic. The new conditions, among others, require participants to be in the country for at least 90 cumulative days in a year and have an offshore income of at least RM40,000 a month compared to RM10,000 previously. They must also have a fixed deposit account of at least RM1 million, with 50 per cent maximum withdrawal allowed for the purpose of buying property or spending on health and children's education. Previously, there was no minimum stay requirement for participants who only needed to place RM300,000 in fixed deposits while for those over 50, the amount was RM150,000. Also new are processing fees of between RM5,000 and RM2,500, which was not imposed previously. On Wednesday, Home Minister Datuk Seri Hamzah Zainudin said the government was prepared to re-examine the new criteria imposed on the programme.", "entities": [{"id": 287, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 12}}, {"id": 288, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 22}}, {"id": 289, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 164, "end_offset": 176}}, {"id": 290, "label": "TITLE", "position": {"start_offset": 198, "end_offset": 205}}, {"id": 291, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 209, "end_offset": 222}}, {"id": 292, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 354, "end_offset": 359}}, {"id": 293, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 744, "end_offset": 756}}, {"id": 294, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 768, "end_offset": 786}}, {"id": 295, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 794, "end_offset": 799}}, {"id": 296, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1324, "end_offset": 1332}}, {"id": 297, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 2439, "end_offset": 2452}}, {"id": 298, "label": "TITLE", "position": {"start_offset": 2453, "end_offset": 2463}}, {"id": 299, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 177, "end_offset": 184}}, {"id": 300, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 189, "end_offset": 197}}, {"id": 301, "label": "TITLE", "position": {"start_offset": 206, "end_offset": 208}}, {"id": 302, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 206, "end_offset": 222}}, {"id": 303, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 198, "end_offset": 222}}, {"id": 304, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 177, "end_offset": 222}}, {"id": 305, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 164, "end_offset": 222}}, {"id": 306, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 732, "end_offset": 739}}, {"id": 307, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 2464, "end_offset": 2479}}, {"id": 308, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 2453, "end_offset": 2479}}, {"id": 309, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 2439, "end_offset": 2479}}], "relations": [{"id": 159, "head": 287, "tail": 288, "relation": "capital of", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 160, "head": 291, "tail": 301, "relation": "award received", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 164, "head": 304, "tail": 289, "relation": "Org-Aff.Founder", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 162, "head": 303, "tail": 300, "relation": "occupation", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 165, "head": 304, "tail": 289, "relation": "chairperson", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 166, "head": 304, "tail": 289, "relation": "founded by", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 168, "head": 308, "tail": 297, "relation": "occupation", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 167, "head": 307, "tail": 298, "relation": "award received", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 161, "head": 302, "tail": 290, "relation": "award received", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 163, "head": 303, "tail": 299, "relation": "occupation", "relation_source": "DocRED"}]}, {"id": "article_209", "text": "GEORGE TOWN, Dec 1  The Penang government does not plan to form any alliance with the opposition parties in the state, the state legislative assembly heard today.

He said the state has implemented several agendas under the Confidence and Supply Agreement (CSA) signed by Pakatan Harapan (PH) leaders at the federal level. 'One of it is the amendment to the state constitution in 2012 to prevent an elected assemblyman from hopping parties,' he said. Other than this, he said the state legislative assembly has also approved the 2018 amendment to the state constitution to limit an individual from holding the chief minister's post to only two terms. 'The Penang state government, under PH, often leads the way in bringing changes to ensure the people's rights are defended at all time,' he said. Chow was reading his reply to an oral question by Dr Afif Bahardin (Bersatu-Seberang Jaya) on whether the state will offer an agreement similar to the CSA to the opposition for the sake of Penang people. Meanwhile, Dr Afif also asked Chow if the state is ready to provide the same amount of allocations to the opposition assemblymen as the ones allocated for PH assemblymen. Chow replied that the opposition assemblymen in Penang are receiving allocations of between RM300,000 and RM400,000 from the federal government.

However, its chairman Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin said travellers must undergo the Covid-19 test before their departure and upon arrival in Malaysia, as per the recommendation of the Health Ministry.  'The reopening of international borders needs to be implemented in a planned manner and based on current risk assessments,' he told a press conference after chairing the NRC meeting today.  Muhyiddin said the reopening of borders would support the country's economic recovery process and other industries related to tourism.  'By doing so, the country's recovery process will be accelerated, where the investors can come, international tourists can visit and subsequently revive our tourism and aviation industries.'  Asked if the reopening is only for selected countries, Muhyiddin replied: 'The reopening is for all countries.'  This, Muhyiddin said as Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin, who was also present, told the meeting that the Omicron Covid-19 variant is now present in many countries.  'As such, we cannot be selective by allowing only selected countries.'    He said should the government agree with the suggestion by the council, further preemptive Covid-19 measures, specific conditions and the standard operating procedures (SOP) such as pre-departure Covid-19 PCR test and others will be announced by the Health Ministry.  Muhyiddin said based on the briefing earlier by the Health Ministry he was confident that the country's public health system can manage daily positive Covid-19 cases based on past experiences.  On Nov 11, Muhyiddin told a press conference that Malaysia's borders should be opened to international visitors by Jan 1 this year.  The reopening, however, had been pushed back indefinitely following the spike in infections involving the Omicron variant.  Malaysian borders have remained largely closed since March 2020, when the first national lockdown was imposed.  Certain exemptions, however, have been made for students, Malaysians returning home from abroad, permanent residents and businessmen.  Meanwhile, when asked about the upcoming Johor State Election, Muhyiddin said as Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu) president he was hoping that some relaxation on the SOP will be given during the campaigning period.

This is when most countries reopen their borders, allowing economic activities to slowly return to normal, said Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob. He explained that the current price increase came about because borders at several countries were closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent movement control order. This prevented Malaysia from importing the essential items needed. Ismail Sabri adds a surge in demand but a drop in supply will also result in prices increasing. He said although the price increase was beyond the control of the government, it nevertheless, did not remain idle, nor did it claim that its hands were tied on the matter.  He added that the government has introduced various measures to alleviate the burden faced by the people following the hike in essential goods prices. 'The government will always look into ways to help the people by prioritising their interests as we do not want them to endure hardship or suffer. Ismail Sabri said the ongoing Keluarga Malaysia (Malaysian Family) sales programme is among the measures taken by the government to assist the people.   'Since vegetable farmers are experiencing an increase in pesticide price, the government has provided subsidies and incentives hoping that the vegetable prices will drop. 'The Keluarga Malaysia sales programme offers discounts up to 50 per cent and will be carried out for three months till March next year until the prices of goods stabilise,' he said. Ismail Sabri said this in his speech when opening the Bera parliamentary-level mass circumcision programme at the Bera District Council Hall here today.  A total of 350 children aged between five and 12 years old took part in the mass circumcision ceremony which was sponsored by Ismail Sabri's constituency office.

Founder and group managing director Tan Sri Leong Hoy Kum said the government should offer more measures targeting first-time homebuyers, specifically in-home financing, to boost homeownership. 'This includes reinstating maximum loan tenure to 40 years and setting the higher margin of financing up to 100 per cent for first property to help the M40 and B40 groups who are affected during the pandemic,' Leong said in a statement. The company also hopes the government can consider implementing the developer interest bearing scheme (DIBS) for first-time home buyers. He said this would allow buyers to have the option to not service their loan interest and rentals at the same time during the construction period. 'Additionally, we proposed the government to grant the extension of Home Ownership Campaign (HOC) for another year, as the campaign has been proven to be vital in helping home buyers to secure their home while reducing the housing overhang situation since it was launched,' he said. Meanwhile, Leong said the government should consider terminating the real property gains tax (RPGT) on properties sold after five years as an impetus to boost the secondary market. He said the re-imposition of RPGT on properties sold five years after the duration would possibly dampen the secondary residential property segment recovery and discourage long-term investment. 'This will also indirectly improve the home buyers' sentiment in property purchase,' he said. Besides, Leong also proposes that the government reduce the minimum threshold for foreign property ownership to RM600,000, although the current minimum threshold for foreign property ownership varies according to state. 'We hope the government can review and standardise the minimum threshold to RM600,000 across all states, especially in the areas with high property overhang such as the Klang Valley, Johor and Penang. 'With the current currency rate, it will attract foreigners to invest in tangible investments, which will help reduce the property overhang,' he said. On the Malaysia My Second Home Programme's (MM2H) programme, Leong has made several proposals to the government, such as lowering the qualifying minimum income, liquid assets, and fixed deposits instead of a drastic increase currently.

In a statement today, Carsome said the funding round is complemented by new credit facilities of US$30 million, bringing the total funds raised to US$200 million. The Series D2 round  the largest equity investment in Carsome's history  saw participation from one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the region, as well as a pool of new international investors such as Catcha Group, MediaTek and Penjana Kapital. It also saw strong participation from existing shareholders including Asia Partners, Gobi Partners, 500 Southeast Asia, Ondine Capital, MUFG Innovation Partners, Daiwa PI Partners and others. Rothschild & Co acted as the financial advisor to Carsome for the deal. According to Carsome co-founder and group chief executive officer Eric Cheng, the latest funding round enables the company to accelerate its organic growth in the retail and auto-financing business. 'We are deeply honoured and encouraged by the confidence and support accorded by our investors. 'We are geared up to achieve even greater heights while rolling out Southeast Asia's integrated car e-commerce platform, now further solidified by various strengths within the ecosystem,' added Cheng. Carsome's latest funding round will empower its strategic focus on the growth and expansion of its business-to-consumer (B2C) business. This year alone, Carsome has opened at least seven B2C retail centers known as Carsome Experience Centres across Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, with several more in the pipeline for the rest of the year. The company has also opened its first vehicle reconditioning centre in Malaysia to add to its array of retail services and boost consumer confidence in its Carsome Certified cars. The funding injection also strengthens Carsome's offering in auto-financing for car buyers and used car dealers. In addition to its numerous financing products, Carsome had recently launched auto financing facilities for graduates who typically face challenges in obtaining loan approvals from conventional banks. Apart from championing the growth of its B2C business, Carsome's Series D2 funding is also expected to boost its capabilities in strategic investments and mergers and acquisitions. This year, the company has acquired an all-equity stake in PT Universal Collection, a Jakarta-based car and motorcycle auction service. It had also entered into a strategic partnership with leading listings and content automotive platform, iCar Asia, to build the largest automotive ecosystem in Southeast Asia, with more transactions expected over the next six months. Carsome transacts more than 100,000 cars on an annualised basis, which translates to around US$1 billion in revenue.", "entities": [{"id": 456, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 0,

State Health Department director Dr Ma'arof Sudin said the investigation would be conducted immediately to improve the delivery of health and medical services to the people. 'The department would like to refer to the viral statement on social media regarding a baby being born inside a car after the mother received initial treatment at the Seberang Jaya Hospital (HSJ) on Dec 27. 'For the information, the HSJ confirmed that the mother had sought treatment at the hospital and examination found that she had signs of early birth. She was then allowed to go home upon the doctor's advice,' he said today Dr Ma'arof said the department held a meeting with the woman's next-of-kin today to get more information and decided to conduct an internal investigation. Meanwhile, Dr Ma'arof urged the public or patients who had any questions, complaints or suggestions to contact the hospital directly so that investigations or improvements could be implemented immediately. Social media was abuzz with news of a woman who delivered her baby inside the car as she could not arrive at the hospital on time. The woman had initially gone to a government hospital because she was already showing signs of delivering the baby. She, however, claimed that she was asked to go home first because it was still not time for her to give birth. The woman then appealed to the hospital to allow her to be admitted to the ward as she is staying in Sungai Ara, Bayan Lepas which is quite far from the hospital, but her appeal was ignored. Shortly after arriving home, the woman told her husband she had to be rushed to the hospital again at about 7pm due to 'bleeding'. However, the travelling time to two government hospitals was between 50 minutes to 1 hour and 20 minutes at that time, due to peak hour traffic. The woman eventually gave birth inside the car on her way to the hospital. Her husband took her to a nearby private hospital and the man had expressed frustration at having to pay 'unexpected' hospital bills and blamed the first hospital for asking his wife to go home.", "entities": [{"id": 495, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 11}}, {"id": 496, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 40}}, {"id": 497, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 193, "end_offset": 216}}, {"id": 498, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 217, "end_offset": 225}}, {"id": 499, "label": "FACILITY", "position": {"start_offset": 534, "end_offset": 556}}, {"id": 500, "label": "FACILITY", "position": {"start_offset": 558, "end_offset": 561}}, {"id": 501, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 797, "end_offset": 807}}, {"id": 502, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 963, "end_offset": 973}}, {"id": 503, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1617, "end_offset": 1627}}, {"id": 504, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1629, "end_offset": 1640}}, {"id": 505, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 600, "end_offset": 603}}, {"id": 506, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 217, "end_offset": 242}}, {"id": 507, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 193, "end_offset": 242}}, {"id": 508, "label": "TITLE", "position": {"start_offset": 226, "end_offset": 228}}, {"id": 509, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 226, "end_offset": 242}}, {"id": 510, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 800, "end_offset": 807}}, {"id": 511, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 965, "end_offset": 973}}, {"id": 512, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 229, "end_offset": 242}}, {"id": 513, "label": "TITLE", "position": {"start_offset": 797, "end_offset": 799}}, {"id": 514, "label": "TITLE", "position": {"start_offset": 963, "end_offset": 965}}], "relations": [{"id": 66, "head": 512, "tail": 508, "relation": "award received", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 67, "head": 506, "tail": 497, "relation": "Org-Aff.Employment", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 68, "head": 506, "tail": 507, "relation": "director / manager", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 69, "head": 499, "tail": 500, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 70, "head": 509, "tail": 498, "relation": "occupation", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 71, "head": 503, "tail": 504, "relation": "Part-Whole.Geo", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 72, "head": 496, "tail": 495, "relation": "location", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 73, "head": 512, "tail": 510, "relation": "given name", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 74, "head": 510, "tail": 513, "relation": "award received", "relation_source": "DocRED"}]}, {"id": "article_217", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Bhd's net profit fell 36.05 per cent to RM25.98 million in the third quarter (Q3) financial year ended September 2021 from RM40.63 million a year ago. The company's revenue also fell 19.8 per cent to RM349.29 million in Q3 2021 from RM435.32 million last year as both Malaysia and Singapore operations registered lower sales following the temporary suspension of brewery operations and the tightening of Covid-19 measures in both countries. According to Carlsberg, Malaysia sales revenue decreased by 24.8 per cent to RM216.9 million primarily attributed to the 11 weeks brewery closure from June 2 to August 15, 2021. On-trade performance was adversely impacted by the dine-in restriction during this period and the continued closure of entertainment and bars outlets. The brewery resumed its operation on August 16, 2021. Profit from operations decreased by 37.1 per cent to RM30.4 million in Q3, in line with the lower sales and compounded by unabsorbed fixed costs from the shutdown of the brewery. This was offset by lower marketing costs due to the deferment of marketing activities during the lockdown period. Malaysia registered a profit from operations of RM17.8 million, a decrease of 33.6 per cent whereas Singapore registered RM12.6 million, a decrease of 41.4 per cent. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2021, the company posted a 4.3 per cent increase in net profit to RM129.6 million despite revenue declining by 6.2 per cent to RM1,230 million. This result was mainly driven by stronger performance in the Singapore operations, successful premium innovations as well as stringent cost measures across the company, the company said. Managing director Stefano Clini said with lockdown restrictions being eased in both Malaysia and Singapore, the company has set plans to launch new products in the coming weeks and will be rolling out exciting year-end festive promotions to help speed up the recovery in both on- and off-trade. Clini said building on the growth momentum of the company's e-commerce sales in both markets, Carlsberg has also enriched its online sales and expanded its footprint to generate positive revenue streams. 'Looking ahead, the brewer remains cautious for the remaining financial year, given the continued closure of entertainment outlets and absence of international tourism throughout the National Recovery Plan (NRP) as well as commodity headwinds.

To encourage adults to get their booster shots, he said the department would increase its outreach programmes and campaign activities, particularly to the target groups.", "entities": [{"id": 532, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 9}}, {"id": 533, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 38}}, {"id": 534, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 123, "end_offset": 143}}, {"id": 535, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 150, "end_offset": 172}}, {"id": 536, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 554, "end_offset": 563}}, {"id": 537, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 575, "end_offset": 582}}, {"id": 538, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 583, "end_offset": 594}}, {"id": 539, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 913, "end_offset": 934}}, {"id": 540, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1046, "end_offset": 1054}}, {"id": 541, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1233, "end_offset": 1238}}, {"id": 542, "label": "TITLE", "position": {"start_offset": 1230, "end_offset": 1232}}, {"id": 543, "label": "TITLE", "position": {"start_offset": 144, "end_offset": 149}}, {"id": 544, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 144, "end_offset": 172}}, {"id": 545, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 123, "end_offset": 172}}, {"id": 546, "label": "TITLE", "position": {"start_offset": 941, "end_offset": 943}}, {"id": 547, "label": "TITLE", "position": {"start_offset": 935, "end_offset": 940}}, {"id": 548, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 944, "end_offset": 956}}, {"id": 549, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 941, "end_offset": 956}}, {"id": 550, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 935, "end_offset": 956}}, {"id": 551, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 913, "end_offset": 956}}, {"id": 552, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1230, "end_offset": 1239}}], "relations": [{"id": 57, "head": 544, "tail": 534, "relation": "occupation", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 56, "head": 532, "tail": 533, "relation": "Part-Whole.Geo", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 58, "head": 535, "tail": 543, "relation": "award received", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 59, "head": 535, "tail": 536, "relation": "given name", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 61, "head": 548, "tail": 546, "relation": "award received", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 62, "head": 549, "tail": 547, "relation": "award received", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 63, "head": 548, "tail": 541, "relation": "given name", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 60, "head": 550, "tail": 539, "relation": "occupation", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 268, "head": 536, "tail": 538, "relation": "occupation", "relation_source": "DocRED"}]}, {"id": "article_219", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: The Malaysian Trades Union Congress (MTUC) has urged the government to raise the minimum wage to RM1500 and the minimum monthly cost of living allowance (Cola) to RM300 for all workers next year.

The pace of expansion was moderate and was thequickest since April.

'We bid for this role due to the project's strategic location, size, and job scope.  'Given our expertise and efficient project management experience, we believe this will be a win-win collaboration for both companies,' he said in a statement today. On 26 January 2022, JIB signed a joint venture (JV) agreement with Menara Rezeki Sdn Bhd (MRSB) and Menara Rezeki Properties Sdn Bhd (MRP) to undertake the redevelopment of the existing Flat PKNS Jalan Tun Razak in Kampong Bharu. The redevelopment project includes relocating existing residents into a new apartment with a comprehensive compensation package. Once the relocation has been completed, the demolition of the Flat PKNS will be conducted responsibly without affecting the local communities in the area. This would then be followed by the redevelopment and construction works.  According to Azmi, the redevelopment project is a promising prospect, given SMTrack's expertise and track record in project management. 'This is a good opportunity for us to utilise our expertise and healthy financial position through value-accretive efforts such as this to enhance the company's earnings visibility going forward,' Azmi said.  Aside from the potential return of earnings, SMTrack - a Bursa Malaysia listed radio frequency identification (RFID) solution provider, is also relishing the opportunity to contribute to the community through this redevelopment project.

Norizam, known for his fiery words on social media, has spoken out against five former Kelantan players following a pay dispute.    Recently, Norizam revealed the salary arrears (individually) of Kelantan's former players, Nazrin Nawi, Farisham Ismail, Nik Akif Syahiran Nik Mat, Shahrul Nizam Ros Hasni and Masaki Watanabe, in a Facebook post.  The total amount owing to the five players is RM158,857 for the month of November, 2020.   This has resulted in PFAM,  headed by Kuala Lumpur City striker Safee Sali, issuing a statement against Norizam, better known as Zamsaham, yesterday.   The players' association said they had expected Norizam to handle the issue professionally as the two parties were still at a correspondence stage.    PFAM said they, on their part, had also advised the five players to respect the due process by not making statements publicly about the case.   '(However) this issue was revealed by the (Kelantan) team themselves, and which has caused negative perceptions among netizens in social media.   'The matter should have been handled  (by Norizam) by replying to the claimant notice (from PFAM) officially. If no agreement was reached, both parties have agreed to extend the matter to the FAM status committee.'   PFAM said The Red Warriors' (TRW)  reason for not making full salary payments for November, 2020 was not  justifiable in the team not honouring their responsibilities in a contract between team and player.   'Among the matters brought up by Norizam was questioning the full payment of salaries if there were  injuries, discipline problems and red card.   'PFAM have no issue with this if the pay cuts follow what is permitted and done according to the terms of the contracts.   'But if they do not follow the terms of the contracts, PFAM think TRW  shouldn't implement the pay cut.'", "entities": [{"id": 659, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 52}}, {"id": 660, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 54, "end_offset": 58}}, {"id": 661, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 76, "end_offset": 87}}, {"id": 662, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 94, "end_offset": 109}}, {"id": 663, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 206, "end_offset": 213}}, {"id": 664, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 293, "end_offset": 301}}, {"id": 665, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 348, "end_offset": 355}}, {"id": 666, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 402, "end_offset": 410}}, {"id": 667, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 429, "end_offset": 440}}, {"id": 668, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 442, "end_offset": 457}}, {"id": 669, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 459, "end_offset": 484}}, {"id": 670, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 486, "end_offset": 509}}, {"id": 671, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 514, "end_offset": 529}}, {"id": 672, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 664, "end_offset": 668}}, {"id": 673, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 681, "end_offset": 698}}, {"id": 674, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 707, "end_offset": 717}}, {"id": 675, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 946, "end_offset": 950}}, {"id": 676, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1133, "end_offset": 1141}}, {"id": 677, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1278, "end_offset": 1285}}, {"id": 678, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1328, "end_offset": 1332}}, {"id": 679, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1428, "end_offset": 1431}}, {"id": 680, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1453, "end_offset": 1457}}, {"id": 681, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1463, "end_offset": 1479}}, {"id": 682, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1482, "end_offset": 1485}}, {"id": 683, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1694, "end_offset": 1701}}, {"id": 684, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1986, "end_offset": 1990}}, {"id": 685, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1997, "end_offset": 2000}}, {"id": 686, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 699, "end_offset": 706}}, {"id": 687, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 747, "end_offset": 754}}, {"id": 688, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 772, "end_offset": 780}}, {"id": 689, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 843, "end_offset": 850}}, {"id": 690, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 88, "end_offset": 93}}, {"id": 691, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 88, "end_offset": 109}}, {"id": 692, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 76, "end_offset": 109}}, {"id": 693, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 699, "end_offset": 716}}, {"id": 694, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 681, "end_offset": 716}}, {"id": 695, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1809, "end_offset": 1813}}], "relations": [{"id": 21, "head": 662, "tail": 663, "relation": "given name", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 22, "head": 659, "tail": 660, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 23, "head": 662, "tail": 661, "relation": "owned by", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 25, "head": 693, "tail": 673, "relation": "Org-Aff.Sports-Affiliation", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 26, "head": 681, "tail": 682, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 254, "head": 662, "tail": 690, "relation": "position held", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 255, "head": 691, "tail": 661, "relation": "Org-Aff.Ownership", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 24, "head": 674, "tail": 686, "relation": "position held", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1599, "head": 667, "tail": 666, "relation": "Org-Aff.Sports-Affiliation", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 1600, "head": 668, "tail": 666, "relation": "Org-Aff.Sports-Affiliation", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 1601, "head": 669, "tail": 666, "relation": "Org-Aff.Sports-Affiliation", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 1602, "head": 670, "tail": 666, "relation": "Org-Aff.Sports-Affiliation", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 1603, "head": 671, "tail": 666, "relation": "Org-Aff.Sports-Affiliation", "relation_source": "ACE05"}]}, {"id": "article_225", "text": "Mohamed Basyir KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia recorded over 5,000 Covid-19 cases for a third consecutive day today.

Minetech's major shareholders Datuk Awang Daud Awang Putera, Choy Sen@Chin Kim Sang and Chin Leong Choy have collectively provided their undertakings to subscribe 256.2 million ICPS. The company said the rights issue was part of its series of corporate exercises and on the basis of one ICPS for every two existing shares held by entitled shareholders. In the abridged prospectus issued on September 23 by the company's principal advisor TA Securities Holdings Bhd, Minetech said any unsubscribed ICPS would be made available for excess applications by entitled shareholders and/or their renouncees or transferees. The undertakings by Awang Daud and the other major shareholders is expected to generate at least RM7.69 million. 'Having evaluated various fund-raising methods, Minetech's board of directors shared that it deemed the right issues of ICPS exercise, alongside private placement of new Minetech shares to be the most appropriate avenue for it to raise the required funds. 'As the recent Covid-19 pandemic and resulting business interruptions have an adverse effect on a global economic scale in the immediate and long term, Minetech views its ability to raise funds expeditiously as crucial to finance our operations by providing more flexibility and financial buffer in terms of cash flow management,' it said.

The Fire and Rescue Department, he said, has also dispatched their personnel and assets to the scene to expedite relief efforts.

'The government will continue to give priority to religious festivals to be celebrated by the devotees involved but this flexibility should be utilised with a full sense of responsibility. 'Every SOP outlined by KPN must be complied with, not only for the safety and health of oneself, but also the people around us,' he said. He said the SOP for the Maasi Magam festival would be implemented from February 16 to 19 and only fully vaccinated individuals were allowed to participate in religious activities, with strict adherence to physical distancing of at least one metre as well as the wearing of face masks. The SOP, among others, stipulates that the travel and movement of chariots were allowed on the condition that there should not be more than 50 individuals from the temple management involved in the procession; no stopping at any location; and the names of those involved as well as the travel route must receive prior approval from the police. Meanwhile, he said prayer ceremonies in conjunction with the Chingay Parade at the Johor Ancient Temple and Xing Gong are allowed from February 19 to 22, and no more than 100 members of the temple management will be allowed to take part in the street cleansing ceremony on February 19. Hishammuddin said on February 20, the ceremony to transport deities from the Johor Ancient Temple to Xing Gong would be allowed, involving no more than 200 members of the temple management. He said the main Chingay Parade event on February 21 was also allowed, with the movement of 11 decorated trucks accompanied by no more than 20 members of the temple management for each truck, and no devotees were allowed to participate in the procession. According to the SOP, the return of the deities from Xing Gong to Johor Ancient Temple on February 22 is allowed with the presence of no more than 200 members of the temple management, while the names of those involved as well as the travel route for the parade must receive prior approval from the police.

'Although stronger growth could pressure import bills, current accounts should remain strong for most Asean markets,' it said in its Asean Market Strategy Outlook 2022. Credit Suisse said Malaysia ranks second in its aggregate Asia Pacific scorecard, and first on valuations. It has currency potential, and the ringgit features strongly on currency metrics. 'It has the region's second lowest real effective exchange rate, relative to the recent history, and the ringgit has underperformed the rise in oil prices,'' the investment bank said. On the negative side, Malaysia lacks the structural potential of Indonesia and Philippines, and the politics remain complex, Credit Suisse noted. 'We keep a slight overweight on Malaysia, which we rank below Indonesia and Singapore in our pecking order, and view it primarily as a currency play,' it added. Credit Suisse is maintaining 'overweight' positions in Asean stock markets, except for Thailand. ''We see ample catalysts and tailwinds for Asean aside from valuations. Economies should bounce back this year, with Asia Pacific's best year-on-year deltas  or change in the asset prices  on gross domestic product (GDP) growth. Earnings per share (EPS) momentum has turned and should continue to outperform regional peers,' it said. 'Foreign ownership remains near all-time lows. As the cyclical upturn takes hold, we expect investors to return their attention to Asean's structural strengths, namely demographics and low digital and credit penetration.''

 Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob said banks were requested to continue assisting borrowers facing financial difficulties in repaying their loans and to postpone legal action against defaulting borrowers. Borrowers who still need assistance are advised to immediately contact their respective banks to discuss appropriate restructuring and rescheduling options. 'The government takes note of the efforts of the banking sector which does not take the easy way out by putting those who are really facing difficulties on the black list of borrowers or bankruptcy list,' he said in a press statement here today. Although the bankruptcy rate has dropped by 50 per cent after the economic sector began to open up gradually since last October, the Malaysian economy will take time to fully recover. In this regard, borrowers who are new or still find difficulty in getting employment, especially the B50 group, should be supported as much as possible until they are able to stand strong again to ensure survival. At the same time, the government through the Malaysian Insolvency Department has also increased the bankruptcy threshold to RM100,000 to provide protection to those who may still be unable to survive financially due to the effects of the pandemic. This provision is made based on the Insolvency Act (1967), and the Temporary Measures to Reduce the Impact of Coronavirus Disease Act 2019 (Covid-19) (2020). URUS In support of B50 borrowers, as announced on October 13, 2021, the banking industry together with the Credit Counseling and Management Agency (AKPK) is actively implementing the Financial Management and Resilience Programme (URUS) for B50 borrowers affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. 'Borrowers who are eligible and intend to apply for facilities under URUS can contact their respective banks before January 31, 2022,' said the prime minister. Under URUS, borrowers will also be provided with comprehensive assistance including personal finance plans tailored based on their financial capabilities, taking into account all types of loans with banking institutions under their name. He said the government also took note that the banking sector had implemented URUS in a transparent and fair manner to help B50 borrowers with a household income of up to RM5,880; as well as job losses or loss of income in excess of 50 per cent of household income as a result of the pandemic. TEKUN, BSN and Agrobank  Apart from the URUS programme, borrowers can still get other assistance from their respective banks that suit their needs and financial situation. Apart from that, for micro-entrepreneurs, RM1.8 billion has been allocated through TEKUN Nasional, Bank Simpanan Nasional and Agrobank which provide financing at a zero per cent rate for at least six months; for loans of up to RM75,000; and an immediate moratorium of between 6 and 12 months, subject to terms and conditions. The government also emphasised social protection for the B40 group, he said. Accordingly, through Budget 2022, among the improvements in social protection initiatives is the Tenang protection voucher facility which is increased to RM75; continuing the additional Job Seeker Allowance and increasing the insured salary ceiling from RM4,000 to RM5,000 to improve social security coverage for the nine million workers covered by the Social Security Organisation (Socso). 'Looking ahead, the government has also reactivated the Social Protection Council (MySPC) which is actively formulating a comprehensive and integrated social security policy for the long term,' he added.", "entities": [{"id": 2249, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 12}}, {"id": 2250, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 36}}, {"id": 2251, "label": "TITLE", "position": {"start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 47}}, {"id": 2252, "label": "NORP", "position": {"start_offset": 775, "end_offset": 784}}, {"id": 2253, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1085, "end_offset": 1116}}, {"id": 2254, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 1278, "end_offset": 1286}}, {"id": 2255, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 1446, "end_offset": 1450}}, {"id": 2256, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1553, "end_offset": 1592}}, {"id": 2257, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1594, "end_offset": 1598}}, {"id": 2258, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 1676, "end_offset": 1680}}, {"id": 2259, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 1804, "end_offset": 1808}}, {"id": 2260, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 1879, "end_offset": 1893}}, {"id": 2261, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 1901, "end_offset": 1905}}, {"id": 2262, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 2211, "end_offset": 2215}}, {"id": 2263, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 2417, "end_offset": 2425}}, {"id": 2264, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 2427, "end_offset": 2432}}, {"id": 2265, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 2434, "end_offset": 2437}}, {"id": 2266, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 2442, "end_offset": 2450}}, {"id": 2267, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 2467, "end_offset": 2471}}, {"id": 2268, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 2682, "end_offset": 2696}}, {"id": 2269, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 2698, "end_offset": 2720}}, {"id": 2270, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 2725, "end_offset": 2733}}, {"id": 2271, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 3355, "end_offset": 3383}}, {"id": 2272, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 3385, "end_offset": 3390}}, {"id": 2273, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 3449, "end_offset": 3474}}, {"id": 2274, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 3476, "end_offset": 3481}}, {"id": 2275, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 1725, "end_offset": 1733}}, {"id": 2276, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 67}}, {"id": 2277, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 67}}, {"id": 2278, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 67}}, {"id": 2279, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 1629, "end_offset": 1674}}], "relations": [{"id": 1205, "head": 2276, "tail": 2251, "relation": "award received", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1206, "head": 2278, "tail": 2250, "relation": "occupation", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1207, "head": 2256, "tail": 2257, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1208, "head": 2279, "tail": 2258, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1209, "head": 2271, "tail": 2272, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1210, "head": 2273, "tail": 2274, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}]}, {"id": "article_233", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 2  The government will organise the #Keluarga Malaysia (#Malaysian Family) sales programme simultaneously in all 222 parliamentary constituencies from this Saturday in an effort to ease the people's burden following the increase in prices of goods. Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob said for a start, the programme which offers daily necessities at between 20 and 50 per cent cheaper, would focus on B40 and M40 residential areas. 'At the initial stage, (it will involve) two areas in every constituency with B40 and M40 residents because the groups are the most affected especially post-Covid-19 pandemic,' he told a press conference after launching the programme at Lembah Pantai's Library Square here today. The one-day programme is a joint effort by various quarters including the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP); Agriculture and Food Industries Ministry and private companies. Ismail Sabri said the organisation of the #Keluarga Malaysia sales programme was expected to be held until February next year, depending on the current situation of prices of goods. The prime minister said the government's effort through several ministries responsible for importing supplies such as vegetables could ensure sufficient supply in the market and subsequently lower the selling price. 'If the prices of goods decline before February, the (#Keluarga Malaysia) sales programme will discontinue, but if prices do not go down, the programme will go on. The important thing is that the government is aware of what the people are going through and will not let them bear the burden alone,' he said. On today's programme, Ismail Sabri thanked 25 retail industry players for selling various daily necessities at cheap prices, thus helping the government reduce the people's burden. In the meantime, the prime minister said the National Action Council on Cost of Living would meet to discuss the causes of the rising prices of goods and determine the short- and long-term intervention methods. He added that besides KPDNHEP, the meeting would also involve the Housing and Local Government Ministry and the Transport Ministry. 'Transportation is often said to be the cause of price hikes. For example, using changing of tyres as an excuse. We don't change tyres every month and we don't want this to be an issue. That is why we also include the Transport Ministry,' he explained.

Its chief Datuk Seri Bung Moktar Radin said a decision would take into account the people's views and support in the constituency. 'In the last state election, we (Barisan Nasional) did not field a candidate to contest in this constituency, it was represented by (Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia) Daud Tampokon. 'However, he lost to Warisan who was represented by Manis Muka Mohd Darah in a six-cornered fight,' he said during a meeting with the Semporna Umno division here.  The last Sabah election was held on Sept 26, 2020. The Bugaya seat was left vacant after Manis Muka, 65, died of kidney failure on Nov 17, 2020. However, the by-election was postponed due to the outbreak of Covid-19 and a state of emergency was declared by the government.  According to Bung Moktar, there is a possibility the Election Commission will call for the by-election in the near future as the spread of the virus is now under control in the country. Bung Moktar who is also Sabah Barisan Nasional (BN) chairman, said the defeat of BN candidate Datuk Abd Razak Tun Sakaran in the 14th general election in Bugaya would not discourage them from fielding a candidate. 'We understand the influence of Parti Warisan Sabah president Datuk Shafie Apdal is still strong, but the people's acceptance towards BN is increasing as proven during the recent Melaka state election,' he said. Bung Moktar said Umno had 180 branches in Bugaya and the chances of winning would be high if all of its members were to give full support to the BN candidate. 'It is important for the Umno division leaders to reach out to the grassroots and all the Women, Youth and Puteri wings must be mobilised.'", "entities": [{"id": 2305, "label": "PERSON", "position":

UMW Holdings Bhd ended 2021 with solid automotive sales of 262,685 vehicles despite subsidiary UMW Toyota Motor Sdn Bhd and associate company Perusahaan Otomobil Kedua Sdn Bhd (Perodua) having mixed performance. UMW Toyota surpassed its 2021 sales target of 62,000 units with a total delivery of 72,394 units, 22.0 per cent more than the 59,320 units registered in 2020. Perodua's sales slipped 13.6 per cent to 190,291 units from 220,154 units in 2020. UMW Toyota saw higher sales in December to 9,289 units in December 2021, up 9.4 per cent than the 8,487 units sold in November 2021, despite the challenges brought about by the flooding last month. As a result, UMW Toyota regained the leadership of the non-national segment. The solid performance was mainly contributed by the introduction of new models as well as the sales tax exemption. Toyota Vios continues to be the best-selling model with 31 per cent of its total sales, followed by the Hilux and Yaris. Perodua closed 2021 with sales of 22,940 units in December, 13.0 per cent higher than the 20,299 units sold in November 2021, mainly due to the recovery in the supply chain. Overall, Perodua's lower 2021 sales volume was affected by the Full Movement Control Order (FMCO), the semiconductor chips shortage and the December flooding, which disrupted the operations of a few of its vendors in the Klang Valley. Perodua's best-selling model for the year was the Myvi, followed by the Axia and Bezza. UMW Holdings president and group chief exective officer Datuk Ahmad Fuaad Kenali said both UMW Toyota and Perodua had shown resilience and performed well considering the headwinds and challenges during the year. 'The encouraging outstanding order book, introduction of new models as well as the extension of the sales tax exemption until June 30 2022 are expected to sustain the automotive sales recovery in 2022,' Ahmad Fuaad said in a statement on Friday.

"text": "PETALING JAYA, Nov 11  The Harimau Malaya may have to forget their intention to play a warm up match against Timor Leste ahead of the 2020 Asean Football Federation (AFF) Cup, slated to kick off December 5 in Singapore. Head coach, Tan Cheng Hoe lamented that time constraints due to the tight schedule of the Malaysia Cup 2021, with the final match to be held Nov 30, was the main reason why the warm up match against Timor Leste was deemed highly unlikely. 'As a coach, we need a warm up match before any tournament starts but I don't see we are going to have it due to the Malaysia Cup 2021 tight schedule,' he told reporters when met here, today. Meanwhile, team manager Datuk Mohd Yusoff Mahadi said Malaysia's arrival in Singapore on December 3 before the first Group B match against Cambodia on December 6 made it difficult for them to arrange the warm-up match against Timor Leste. He did not rule out the possibility that the match could take place if the national team arrived earlier in Singapore on December 1 compared to the December 3 date set by the organisers. Yesterday, the Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) had tried to ensure that the national squad get at least one warm-up match before starting their AFF Cup 2020 campaign. FAM secretary-general Mohd Saifuddin Abu Bakar was reported to have said that so far, the Timor Leste team were the main choice as an opponent to test the level of ability of Cheng Hoe's charges. Mohd Yusof has also suggested to Cheng Hoe to call up any player who is not tied to any Malaysia Cup match to join the national squad training camp ahead of the tournament in Singapore after the quarter-finals of the prestigious local football tournament. 'I discussed with Cheng Hoe that after the quarter-finals,any players we have be called as soon as possible for him to prepare, then we add other players after the Malaysia Cup final,' he said. In the AFF Cup 2020, Malaysia who are drawn in Group B, dubbed the 'group of death', will open their campaign against Cambodia on December 6, followed by Laos (December 9) and two epic clashes against Vietnam (December 12) and Indonesia (December 19) in the quest to grab a slot in the semi -finals.

the Thaipusam celebration ended last Tuesday. Speaking to Bernama, its Trustee, Datuk N. Sivakumar, said the temple was making all preparations for Hindu devotees to pay their vows, including bringing 'paal koodam' (milk pot offering) and 'kavadi' and shaving their hair as penance for answered prayers until Jan 30. 'Many were unable to fulfil their vows on Thaipusam day, so prayer ceremonies including kavadi, paal koodam and shaving are allowed from 5 am to 10 pm and the temple will probably operate longer if there are many devotees,' he said. He added that all prayer ceremonies in conjunction with Thaipusam would maintain the standard operating procedures (SOP) under Phase Four of the National Recovery Plan (PPN) and the public do not have to register online for any ceremonies. Hindus celebrated Thaipusam on Jan 18 during 'Thai' which is the 10th month in the Tamil calendar, to commemorate the event of Lord Murugan receiving a sacred spear ('Vel') from his mother Goddess Parvati to vanquish the evil Soorapadman and restore prosperity and well-being of the people. In conjunction with the festival, Hindus will fulfil their vows by upholding the 'paal koodam' which is considered the most sacred and the 'kavadi' (decorated metal frame held by silver spikes pierced into the body) by climbing the 272 steps of Batu Caves towards the Murugan temple inside the cave. The government had set several SOPs for Thaipusam celebration this year (on Jan 19) including disallowing kavadi, limiting the number of devotees entering the temple grounds to 9,000 and prayer ceremonies of 18 sessions with a maximum of 500 per session. Sivakumar said the temple, which is world-famed for its largest statue of Lord Murugan with a height of 42.7 metres would also house around 70 to 80 stalls selling clothes, prayer utensils, food and drinks. He asked those present to fulfil their vows to abide by all SOPs set to curb the spread of Covid-19. Checks by Bernama at the temple found some Hindus bearing paal koodam and shaving their hair and contractors were seen busy setting up stalls in compliance with the SOP, but no kavadi was seen in the vicinity of the temple. Earlier this month, the Sri Mariamman Devasthanam Kuala Lumpur Committee which manages the Batu Caves temple allowed the ceremony to bear kavadi since the new year before stopping it after the Gombak District Police Headquarters on Jan 9 issued a RM1,000 compound to the temple after devotees failed to comply with SOPs", "entities": [{"id": 2428, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 12}}, {"id": 2429, "label": "FACILITY", "position": {"start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 54}}, {"id": 2430, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 58, "end_offset": 68}}, {"id": 2431, "label": "NORP", "position": {"start_offset": 95, "end_offset": 101}}, {"id": 2432, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 181, "end_offset": 190}}, {"id": 2433, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 235, "end_offset": 242}}, {"id": 2434, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 248, "end_offset": 255}}, {"id": 2435, "label": "TITLE", "position": {"start_offset": 257, "end_offset": 262}}, {"id": 2436, "label": "NORP", "position": {"start_offset": 325, "end_offset": 330}}, {"id": 2437, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 536, "end_offset": 545}}, {"id": 2438, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 783, "end_offset": 792}}, {"id": 2439, "label": "NORP", "position": {"start_offset": 967, "end_offset": 973}}, {"id": 2440, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 985, "end_offset": 994}}, {"id": 2441, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 1013, "end_offset": 1017}}, {"id": 2442, "label": "NORP", "position": {"start_offset": 1050, "end_offset": 1055}}, {"id": 2443, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1094, "end_offset": 1106}}, {"id": 2444, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1156, "end_offset": 1171}}, {"id": 2445, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1193, "end_offset": 1204}}, {"id": 2446, "label": "NORP", "position": {"start_offset": 1292, "end_offset": 1298}}, {"id": 2447, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1503, "end_offset": 1513}}, {"id": 2448, "label": "FACILITY", "position": {"start_offset": 1526, "end_offset": 1540}}, {"id": 2449, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 1598, "end_offset": 1607}}, {"id": 2450, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1813, "end_offset": 1822}}, {"id": 2451, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1887, "end_offset": 1899}}, {"id": 2452, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 2131, "end_offset": 2138}}, {"id": 2453, "label": "NORP", "position": {"start_offset": 2164, "end_offset": 2170}}, {"id": 2454, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 2369, "end_offset": 2417}}, {"id": 2455, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 2436, "end_offset": 2446}}, {"id": 2456, "label": "FACILITY", "position": {"start_offset": 2538, "end_offset": 2573}}, {"id": 2457, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 263, "end_offset": 275}}, {"id": 2458, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 257, "end_offset": 275}}, {"id": 2459, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 248, "end_offset": 275}}], "relations": [{"id": 1289, "head": 2429, "tail": 2430, "relation": "location", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1290, "head": 2457, "tail": 2435, "relation": "award received", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1291, "head": 2458, "tail": 2434, "relation": "occupation", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1292, "head": 2459, "tail": 2433, "relation": "Org-Aff.Employment", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 1293, "head": 2431, "tail": 2432, "relation": "participant", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1294, "head": 2457, "tail": 2450, "relation": "given name", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1295, "head": 2448, "tail": 2447, "relation": "location", "relation_source": "DocRED"}]}, {"id": "article_238", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 20  Malaysia's Covid-19 related deaths returned to double digits today with 13 fatalities after yesterday's lowest record in the past nine months.

The government is expected to set a higher GDP growth target for 2022, aiming for 5 to 6 per cent growth, up from 3 to 4 per cent in 2021. UOB senior economist Julia Goh said pending the passage of a higher debt ceiling at 65 per cent to fund an additional RM45 billion Covid-19 expenditure, the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to remain below the new threshold at 63 per cent in 2022. 'The government is anticipated to enact the Fiscal Responsibility Act next year, broaden the revenue base, introduce Public Service Act, and new Public-Private Partnership (PPP) blueprint to attain long-term fiscal sustainability,' she said in a note.

'We need to accept the decision in a mature manner. What's crucial is that teachers who hold a position in a political party must not neglect their duty. 'We also hope that teachers who are affiliated to a political (entity) should not use that as a channel to get positions in the District Education Office or state Education Department,' he told Berita Harian when contacted today.

He said the decision was made at a recent cabinet meeting and the Education Ministry would soon issue a circular on the matter. However, he said teachers and Kemas staff are subject to rules set by their respective departments. Commenting further, Aminuddin said NUTP hoped that the country's political landscape would become more mature and orderly with the involvement of teachers like what had happened in the 1950s and 1960s. 'Back then, teachers were very important in determining the country's political direction,' he added.

Environment and Water Minister Datuk Seri Tuan Ibrahim Tuan Man said the country suffered huge losses of up to billions of ringgit every time floods occurred; therefore, the one-off solution must be implemented immediately based on the requirements of the respective states. 'We will give priority (to upgrade embankments) in areas that are prone to floods, such as the states on the East Coast like Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang and Johor, and even in Selangor, which prior to this, has never been hit (by major floods).

He was commenting on a recent media report which stated that residents living along the coast were at risk of extreme impact from climate change in the next 10 years, if mitigation measures, especially efforts to upgrade sea dikes were not implemented immediately. Asked about the allocation to upgrade the embankments, Tuan Ibrahim said the exact amount could not be stated as yet, but that it would be relatively large. According to him, the allocation required for the proposed long-term solution to the flood phenomenon nationwide exceeds RM300 billion, with phased implementation until the year 2100.

Meanwhile, on the project in Kampung Kubang Parit, he said a total of RM4.5 million was allocated for works that involved upgrading to a concrete drain spanning about one kilometre.

HLIB said Affin Bank Bhd, Alliance Bank Malaysia Bhd, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd had seen lower-than-expected loan loss provision while RHB Bank Bhd booked in stronger-than-expected total income. Another four banks - AMMB Holdings Bhd, Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd (BIMB), Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank) and Public Bank Bhd - came in line with the firm's estimates. HLIB said while Q3 sector earnings declined six per cent on the back of negative jaws ratio, ex-Maybank, the lower provision for bad loans (-17 per cent) helped to cushion the overall impact. 'We note the profit increase for Affin, Alliance and AMMB was mainly due to this reason while RHB experienced stronger total income growth,' it said. HLIB said despite the slight negative jaws ratio generated from quicker operating expenditure growth (up 1.0 per cent) versus total income (flattish), sector bottom-line rose 25 per cent, thanks to lower allowance for bad loans (-31 per cent). At the top, the broadening in net interest margin (NIM) (up 15 basis points) and loans growth (up 4.0 per cent) were erased by poor non-interest income (NOII) (-23 per cent). 'Outliers with profit drop were BIMB, Maybank and Public Bank because of weaker top-line performance, which resulted in larger negative jaws,' it added. HLIB expects domestic banks' NIM to come under slight pressure due to deposit rivalry (typical year end affair) and limited scope for further current account savings account (CASA) expansion. 'Also, lending growth is anticipated to chug along given economic reopening,' it said. HLIB said separately, gross impaired loan (GIL) ratio was likely to creep upwards but it was not overly worried as banks had made heavy pre-emptive provisioning in financial year 2020 (FY20). 'In our view, credit risk has been adequately priced in by the market, looking at the high net credit cost (NCC) assumption applied for FY21 by both us and consensus (above the normalised run-rate but below FY20's level). 'Furthermore, we believe the government and Bank Negara Malaysia will stay supportive in helping troubled borrowers, limiting a significant deterioration in GIL ratio,' it added. HLIB has retained its 'Overweight' outlook on the sector. 'The sector's risk-reward profile continues to skew favourably to the upside as most negatives have been considered by the market. 'In our opinion, Covid-19 woes will likely fizzle out in 2022 while the state of the economy and banking sector will only get better in time.

He said despite being eliminated in the quarter-finals, the national team, which has an average age of 23, put up a great fight against the top in the world, who were also more experienced. He said the campaign also provided good exposure to young players in the effort to make Malaysia a badminton powerhouse. 'They did not lose easily, they put up a great fight. This means the decision was right and we also want to see greater success after this. 'Nobody in Malaysia expected the team to bring back the trophy, we did not set that target,' he said during a press conference after attending the closing ceremony of Mobile Legends Pro League (MPL) Malaysia Season 8 here today. In the quarter-final action that took place on Friday, Malaysia lost 0-3 to archrivals Indonesia, thus failing to avenge the defeat in the same stage against the latter in the 2018 edition of the competition. Malaysia last won the Thomas Cup in 1992 in Kuala Lumpur, and the 2014 edition in India was the last time the squad made it to the finals. Meanwhile, commenting on Malaysia's performance in the Uber Cup, Ahmad Faizal said the national women's squad with an average age of 21, performed well despite great challenges from superpowers. He hoped that all parties would continue to support the country's men's and women's teams which are gunning for success by 2024. 'I believe with what we have experienced this time around, our players will show better performance in future tournaments. As supporters, I hope we can continue to support them so that they can bounce back from this defeat,' he said.

He said with the present Ro/Rt of 1.2, Malaysia is expected to reach 22,000 Covid-19 cases by end of March this year, hence it is everyone's responsibility to comply with all public health and social measures. Dr Noor Hisham said increasing the vaccination and booster shot coverage could also reduce the transmission, as well as lower the Ro/Rt to less than 1. 'We are not out of the woods yet. The onus is on us now to come together and brace the surge of cases. However, more importantly, we have to anticipate the high number of cases with less severity, less hospitalisation and less fatality,' he said.

satellite units to prioritise healthcare and welfare in the state. In a statement, Miri MP Dr Michael Teo Yu Keng said Sarawak's health system is in a critical condition and needs special allocations. 'It is pointless having billions of ringgit in reserves in resource-rich Sarawak if the state of healthcare in Sarawak is deplorable and puts the lives of ordinary Sarawakians at risk,' he said. According to him, Sarawak currently has 22 hospitals and 229 public clinics for its 2.9 million population; with many rural clinics run only by nurses and medical assistants. He said PKR would upgrade health facilities in every district and ensure they are sufficiently staffed. 'Every hospital will be complete with diagnostic facilities, radiology, emergency services, surgeons, trauma and orthopaedics, and an Intensive Care Unit, as well as ensured of adequate medical equipment,' he said. According to him, a specialist cancer hospital would be built in Kuching with satellite treatment units in Bintulu, Sibu, and Miri. Dr Teo said an ophthalmology hospital is also needed here to reduce congestion at Sarawak General Hospital in Kuching and lighten the burden of many patients who cannot afford long distance travel from rural areas to the state capital. He claimed PKR would also roll out breast and cervical cancer screening programmes throughout Sarawak, especially in rural areas. Dr Teo added PKR would push for increased funding and resources from the federal government, while topping up funding from the state reserves. PKR is contesting 28 out of the 82 seats in the 12th Sarawak election.", "entities": [{"id": 777, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}}, {"id": 778, "label":

On Sunday, underdogs Sarawak pulled off a come-from-behind 2-1 victory against Pahang at Stadium Darul Makmur in Kuantan.   Abdul Rahim Razak's goal in the fourth minute of injury time  eliminated Pahang early from the Malaysia Cup.  Sarawak, second in Group A, got an unassailable four-point lead over Pahang.   The Golden Hornbill  worked hard for the sensational victory, which they fully deserved, even though Dollah Salleh's Pahang controlled much of  the match.    Sarawak coach E. Elavarasan praised his men for their never-say-die attitude despite being under pressure throughout the match.   'From early on, Pahang looked better than us. Their early goal shocked us but we managed to give a response,' said Elavarasan.   'In the second half, Pahang were still the better side until we got the last minute goal.    'When it got to 1-1, it gave us the motivation that we can't lose this game.  'We accept the good fortune that came with the late counter that got us the goal and the victory.'   Kenny Athiu had given Pahang the lead in the 13th minute with a header, but  Sandro da Silva equalised for Sarawak in the 31st minute, and it was a goal that got the visitors thinking that victory was possible,   Apart from Sarawak, the other team who booked their quarter-final ticket over the weekend were Kuala Lumpur City FC.

Malacca Securities Sdn Bhd said the FBM KLCI slipped from Monday's rebound, in tandem with the global stock markets performances yesterday.

He added that this was due to their disappointment with the previous Pakatan Harapan (PH) federal government. He said the recorded turnout was in the range of 40 to 45 per cent at urban polling stations where Chinese voters are the majority. 'For polling stations where the majority voters were Bumiputera, the turnout rate was in the range of 65 to 75 per cent,' he said during a press conference after chairing a state DAP committee meeting. Chong said in the 2018 general election, the turnout of Chinese voters exceeded 65 per cent. 'We accept and respect the decision of the voters. We acknowledge that the low turnout is due to the general sentiment and disappointment felt by the electorate in many of our constituencies,' he said. He said PH had been unable to match the expectations of the people during its 22 months in power. 'And for that reason, we would like to apologise to them for not being able to match their expectations during the 22 months,' said Chong, who was one of only two DAP candidates elected in the state election. He said the local party issue was not among the reasons for the state DAP's poor performance as it has been around for more than 40 years. 'To those who voted for DAP in 2018, to bring about a change of federal government, but in this state election, have decided not to support DAP because we did not live up to your expectations, we wish to extend our sincere apologies for falling short of such expectations,' he said. He said the state DAP will continue with its political struggle by upholding the principles of transparency, accountability, good governance and fairness in the government system. 'We will continue to play our role as a responsible Opposition, supporting what is right and opposing what is wrong by the government of the day,' he said. Apart from Chong, who won in Padungan, the other DAP candidate was voted in during the state election was Violet Yong in Pending.

works for the Mass Rapid Transit Line 3 (MRT3 Circle Line) could be issued as early as the second quarter of 2022 with an evaluation period of at least six months. CGS-CIMB Research said the final contract of civil works are expected to be announced in the fourth quarter of 2022 after the evaluation period, while the commencement of civil works would be in phases, beginning 2023. The research firm said under Mass Rapid Transit Corp Sdn Bhd's (MRT Corp) new strategy, MRT 3 Circle Line, will not adopt the single turnkey contractor structure as seen in MRT 2 and will likely divide the scope of the civil works into three to five main packages. Each work package will be led by tier one contractors or consortiums undertaking private financing for the first two years before reverting to total government funding, likely in 2024. However, CGS-CIMB Research did not discount potential execution risks such as delay in cabinet approval of MRT 3's hybrid funding model, low take-up by tier one contractors who are less willing to take on funding risks and potential uncertainties in land acquisition. To note, the land acquisition cost is borne by the government, which could hold up site mobilisation and delay construction works, the research firm said in a recent research report. MRT Corp is currently expecting the Cabinet's approval of the MRT3 Circle Line hybrid funding model by the end of this year. Chief executive officer Datuk Mohd Zarif Hashim said the project structure is likely to be finalised in the first quarter of 2022 to determine how contractors can undertake the private sector funding portions of the civil works. 'If MRT 3 progress newsflow regains momentum in the coming months, interest on MRT 3 rail plays could make a comeback in the short-term as investors' perception of the MRT 3 project has been lukewarm due to delays and the lack of funding allocations as revealed in the key infra targets of 2022 Budget,' CGS-CIMB Research said. Meanwhile, the research firm also said the division in civil works appeared to be negative for the MMC-Gamuda joint venture. Nonetheless, the civil work might be compensated by an estimated RM10 billion to RM15 billion (RM1 billion per km cost) single tunnelling package, supported by the MMC-Gamuda's track record in MRT 1 and MRT 2. CGS-CIMB Research said the domestic rail supply chain will be maximised, including higher usage of industrial building systems (IBS) and more work package contractors. This is to achieve a higher economic multiplier of three to four times than the low of two times for MRT 1 and 2. CGS-CIMB Research said there might be execution risks, but MRT 3 sentiment could improve, given more clarity on the MRT 3 project in the first half of 2022. 'This should allay investor concerns over whether this mega rail project can move ahead with its pre-tender stages in 2022, and we view this as positive.' CGS-CIMB Research said has retained the sector on a Neutral stance on the construction sector but prefer Gamuda Bhd and IJM Corp Bhd for their rail credentials and strong balance sheet for MRT 3 private sector funding. These companies would likely be potential frontrunners of Tier-One civil works tenders for the MRT 3 project. 'We also prefer HSS Engineers Bhd as the group could secure sizeable engineering consultancy scopes from MRT 3 ahead of the civil works tenders.'", "entities": [{"id": 994, "label": "LOCATION",

In a statement today, chief statistician Datuk Seri Mohd Uzir Mahidin said among the factors contributing to the decline were the enforcement of the enhanced movement control order as well as phase one and phase two of the National Recovery Plan, which imposed strict conditions to resume construction activities. 'The decline in the value of construction work done was also in line with the reduced production and imports of construction materials. 'A quarter-on-quarter comparison also showed the value of construction work done contracted by -12.2 per cent from the previous quarter,' he said. The three major construction subsectors, namely civil engineering, residential buildings, and non-residential each contracted by -29.7 per cent, -24.9 per cent, and -10.4 per cent, respectively, compared with the same quarter last year. However, the special trades activities subsector bucked the trend, growing at 21.0 per cent in the third quarter of 2021 as compared to the same quarter last year, DOSM said. In the third quarter of 2021, Kelantan, Pahang, Penang, Sabah, and Terengganu were the five states that recorded positive growth in the value of construction work done driven by public infrastructure and non-residential projects. On the other hand, despite the value of construction work done growing negatively, Selangor recorded the highest value of construction work done with RM5.5 billion or a share of 19.4 per cent, followed by the Federal Territory and Sarawak with 16.7 per cent and 12.8 per cent, respectively. DOSM also reported that the value of construction work done was dominated by the civil engineering sub-sector since the fourth quarter of 2015, with a share of 40.7 per cent. This was followed by non-residential buildings (27.2 per cent), residential buildings (23.3 per cent), and special trade activities (8.8 per cent), it added. DOSM said the private sector continued to drive construction activities with a share of 55.2 per cent or RM13.7 billion of the total value of construction work done, as compared to the public sector with 44.8 per cent share (RM11.1 billion).", "entities": [{"id": 1038, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 12}}, {"id": 1039, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 177, "end_offset": 210}}, {"id": 1040, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 212, "end_offset": 216}}, {"id": 1041, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 241, "end_offset": 259}}, {"id": 1042, "label": "TITLE", "position": {"start_offset": 260, "end_offset": 270}}, {"id": 1043, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 271, "end_offset": 288}}, {"id": 1044, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1217, "end_offset": 1221}}, {"id": 1045, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1258, "end_offset": 1266}}, {"id": 1046, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1268, "end_offset": 1274}}, {"id": 1047, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1276, "end_offset": 1282}}, {"id": 1048, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1284, "end_offset": 1289}}, {"id": 1049, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1295, "end_offset": 1305}}, {"id": 1050, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1541, "end_offset": 1549}}, {"id": 1051, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1667, "end_offset": 1684}}, {"id": 1052, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1689, "end_offset": 1696}}, {"id": 1053, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1749, "end_offset": 1753}}, {"id": 1054, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 2082, "end_offset": 2086}}, {"id": 2788, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 260, "end_offset": 288}}, {"id": 2789, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 241, "end_offset": 288}}], "relations": [{"id": 520, "head": 1039, "tail": 1040, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 521, "head": 1043, "tail": 1042, "relation": "award received", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 522, "head": 1043, "tail": 1041, "relation": "occupation", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 523, "head": 2788, "tail": 1039, "relation": "Org-Aff.Membership", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 524, "head": 1039, "tail": 1053, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 525, "head": 1039, "tail": 1044, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 526, "head": 1039, "tail": 1054, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}]}, {"id": "article_265", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: As the world faces the pandemic and is aiming for recovery, the business and public sectors must be extra vigilant and not resort to corruption.

The session began with a presentation of an Overview of Anti-Corruption Efforts in Malaysia which included anti-corruption initiatives, laws and policies.    Among them are guidelines on gifting, enforcement of the corporate liability provision Section 17A of the MACC Act, the Organisation Anti-Corruption Plan (OACP), the Corruption-Free Pledge (IBR), asset declaration, procurement portal and the corruption offenders 'name and shame' database. The presentation was conducted by MACC Deputy Director of Community Education Mohamad Tarmize Abd Manaf followed by a dialogue session with business expatriates representing countries such as the United States, European Union (EU), China, Canada, United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, India, Indonesia and Taipei. Several MACC top officials participated in the dialogue session, namely Deputy Chief Commissioner (Prevention) Datuk Seri Norazlan Mohd Razali, Director of Anti-Money Laundering Division Zamri Zainul Abidin and Director of Inspection and Consultancy Division Nazli Rasyid Hj Sulong. The programme, jointly organised by the MACC and the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Foundation (YARM), also received the cooperation of three strategic partners this year, namely the Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM), Transparency International Malaysia (TI-M) and the Association of Certified Integrity Officers Malaysia (ACeIO). The programme was also conducted simultaneously by the MACC State Offices physically and virtually between the MACC and international corporate leaders involving various industry sectors in selected locations. Davita Malaysia head of compliance Sumita Menon said the explanation of the implementation of Corporate Liability in Section 17A of the MACC Act 2009 was very important especially on the interpretation of certain words in the act.    Sumita, who is also a member of the American Malaysian Chamber of Commerce (AMCHAM), said the dialogue session was very fruitful as the MACC officials were approachable, responsive, and clear in giving clarifications that allowed for better understanding. 'The session explained to me who the senior management was and who will be liable in cases of an alleged corruption and how the MACC investigates the matter. 'Besides that, the panelists also explained how an individual is charged and to what extent the company will be liable or impacted,' she said, adding that the information was crucial for her as the head of compliance in her company. Echoing her praises for the MACC, Taipei Investors' Association in Malaysia president Lim Kai Min said he was pleased to know that the MACC was listening to the voices of expats and willing to assist them with their problems.    'We would like more information and sources about the policies and services that the MACC can provide. We have an internal auditing team in the company to audit the standard operating procedures and we would like to put more anti-corruption effort on this,' he said.", "entities": [{"id": 1055, "label":

Jovian added that those who were unhappy with him are free to unfollow him on social media. 'If you don't like me, don't follow me. It's better to help the country than to continue accusing me of untruths. 'There are many more things out there which need to be done to help the people. Yes, there are people suffering.

month-on-month (MoM) to 363,000 in September 2021, following the success of the Langkawi Travel Bubble and the progress of the National Recovery Plan (NRP). In a statement today, the airport operator said passenger movements for Malaysia jumped 55 per cent last month, comprising 362,000 (domestic) and 96,000 (international). 'Domestic aircraft movements increased 20 per cent MoM in September, registering more than 10,000 flights. 'We are optimistic about the encouraging travel trend will continue with the lifting of the interstate and international travel restrictions,' it added. During the initial implementation between September 16 to September 29, the Langkawi Travel Bubble recorded about 37,000 passenger movements. Local airlines had also benefitted from it with AirAsia, recording the most aircraft movements with 176 flights and commanding the majority of the average seat factor at 64 per cent during the same period. 'The upward trend is further boosted by the lifting of interstate travel restrictions this month that applies for all areas nationwide except those still under Enhanced Movement Control Order (EMCO).' Meanwhile, MAHB's Turkish asset, Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen International Airport (ISG), posted 2.7 million passenger movements in September. MAHB said ISG remained the main contributor to the group's total passenger movements of 3.2 million passengers in September 2021. 'ISG continues to show strong recovery driven by accelerated vaccination roll-out rates and border relaxation in Europe. 'Ranked among the top countries with access to the vaccine, Turkey projects a high inoculation rate of the nation to achieving public immunity by the end of 2021.' To date, about 74.5 per cent of the Turkish population has been fully vaccinated. This month, the country will also be rolling out the mass production of its developed Covid-19 vaccine, Turkovac, intensifying its efforts to return to normalcy. On the group's cargo operations, the arrival of China Central Longhao Airlines to Kuala Lumpur International Airport last month continued to validate air cargo's increasing importance within the local aviation landscape.

Perak Fire and Rescue Department operation assistant director Muhamad Shahrizal Aris said trackers dogs fromthe Putrajaya K9 unit are also being used to sweep the area and check if there are potentially other people who may have been unknowingly caught in the landslide. 'At the moment, the Public Works Department is trying to clear the debris at the landslide spot so that the K9 Unit can search if there are other victims buried under the landslide,\" he told reporters here. He said rescuers will conduct a sweepof the area twice more and if there are no signs and will decide after that whether to continue or end the search operations. At the moment, he said there are no signs of any other vehicle being buried beneath the rubble other than the lorry and a multipurpose vehicle (MPV) as reported earlier. Muhamad Shahrizal said rescuers are concerned there may be further soil movement in the area and are checking with the Perak Mineral and Geoscience Department the soil conditions, as well as the weather. 'We might stop the cleaning workif the weather doesn't permit us to continue the work. 'But for now there is no movement on the soil,' he said, adding the depth of the landslide is about five to seven metres. So far, rescuers have extracted the wreckage of the MPV, a Toyota Alphard. The lorry remains buried. The landslide was said to have happened at about 1.30pm yesterday, killing two people. The victims have been identified as Muhammad Hafiz Hamdi, 31, from Tanjung Piandang in Kerian, who was driving a lorry carrying vegetables and Tan Chee Heng, 36, from Klang, Selangor, who was driving the Toyota Alphard. Perak police chief Datuk Mior Faridalathrash Wahid said the rescue team managed to retrieve the two bodies after nearly 10 hours of operation. 'The first body was of Tan, who was in a Toyota Alphard.

Tanah Melayu Capital Bhd (TMCB) will sign an agreement with Kazakhstan's Ministry of Trade and Integration to establish Qazaq Trade Hub, the country's regional trade hub, in Kuala Lumpur. The Qazaq Trade Hub, the first of its kind in Southeast Asia, is a comprehensive one-stop centre to enhance trade and investment between Kazakhstan and Malaysia.  It will also be a primary platform for Kazakhstan to reach out and engage other countries within the Southeast Asia region to bolster commercial opportunities and business activities. TMCB director Ridhwan Rosli said the company is deeply appreciative of the trust and confidence showed by the Kazakhstan Ministry of Trade and Integration in appointing TMCB to spearhead the Qazaq Trade Hub project in Malaysia. 'TMCB is able to combine our expertise in information communications and technology (ICT) alongside our local market insights and relationship with key public and private stakeholders to make Qazaq Trade Hub a success,' he said in a statement today. TMCB is a home-grown information technology and business networking specialist. A digital MoU signing ceremony will be held in the nearest date and will be witnessed by the head of state from both Kazakhstan and Malaysia. According to Ridhwan, Malaysia's strategic location in the heart of Southeast Asia makes it an ideal site for the Qazaq Trade Hub.  'Malaysia is currently Kazakhstan's largest trading partner in the region, with the trade of about RM600 million in value per annum.  'The presence of this hub is expected to bolster trade further while potentially drive more foreign direct investments into Malaysia,' he added. Republic of Kazakhstan Trade and Integration vice-minister Assel Zhubanyshevna Zhanassova said the Qazaq Trade Hub reaffirms that the country is open for business and is pro-actively seeking avenues to grow and diversify trade and investment in the spirit of global economic collaboration. 'Kazakhstan has a lot of products, technologies and talent to offer Malaysia and its neighbours in the Southeast Asia region and vice versa.  'Growth in exports and imports between our country and the region can only be mutually beneficial to our respective economy and society,' she added. 'Given our geographical location, Kazakhstan can also be a transit hub between Southeast Asia and Europe, in particular nations of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU).  'This transit hub would enable new trade paradigms that can generate jobs, enrich lives and secure our natural resources, she said. Assel said in order to fully unlock the value of the country's relationship with Malaysia and Southeast Asia, it is critical that both parties work alongside a partner like TMCB who not only knows the local market and stakeholders but is also able to bring a technological edge to positioning Kazakhstan as an attractive trade and investment destination.", "entities": [{"id": 1255, "label":

Although Russia has a large physical presence in the region, it is not a major trading partner with APAC countries, the research house said. 'There is little reliance on exports to Russia and, with few exceptions, what reliance there is has not increased in recent years,' it said in a Feb 25 commentary titled 'APAC's direct trade with Russia'. It noted that exports to Russia account for no more than one per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in any of the major APAC countries. As for imports, Moody's said no APAC economy is highly dependent on imports from Russia, which represent less than one per cent of nominal GDP for any of the major APAC countries. 'The greatest volatility of the value of imports from Russia has been in Singapore, where refined petroleum  with its volatile price  accounts for about 75 per cent of imports from Russia. And Singapore's imports from Russia have never amounted to more than two per cent of all of its imports,' it added. By far, the region's largest exporter of goods to Russia is China, amounting to US$51 billion (US$1=RM4.20) in 2020, Moody's said, citing the International Monetary Fund's Direction of Trade Statistics. These were made up largely of computers, electronics and machinery  including mobile phones  and vehicle parts. 'Second-ranked South Korea exported US$6.9 billion the same year, followed closely by Japan with US$5.8 billion,' it said. Moody's said that exports to Russia are somewhat important for China, however, as it is also the largest importer within APAC of goods from Russia, with nearly 70 per cent of Russian imports comprising energy-related products, including crude oil, refined petroleum and coal briquettes. Natural gas is a small import component, Moody's said, noting that it is expected to rise with the recent agreement between China and Russia to expand pipeline capacity between the two countries. Nevertheless, only two per cent of China's total exports go to Russia. Moody's said while the direct impact of diminished trade is small for APAC, the indirect impact of longer-lasting global energy price inflation, due to a lingering risk premium on crude and refined energy products, will weigh on the region's economy. 'And much of this will be felt through higher input costs for food production, which accounts for a larger share of household budgets in the region compared with Europe or North America,' it added.",

In light of the 12th Malaysia Plan, China is willing to work together with Malaysia to strengthen trade and investment cooperation, tap into the potential for cooperation in emerging fields, and promote the economic integration of China-Malaysia towards common developments for both countries, he said. Potential areas of cooperation include the digital economy, electrical and electronics industry, high-tech and cyber security, he said. 'As an important node of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, Malaysia enjoys a strategic location and a sound business environment. 'We are willing to share experience in opening up and development with Malaysia, continue to deepen practical cooperation and strategic synergising and cooperation planning, so as to promote the economic recovery and social development in the post-pandemic era. 'We are supposed to turn the crisis into an opportunity, which will bring our cooperation to a higher level and yield valuable and remarkable results,' he said at the launch of the Cainiao Aeropolis electronic World Trade Platform (eWTP) Hub here today. Ouyang said the bilateral trade volume between China and Malaysia and China's non-financial investment to Malaysia increased against the odds by 43.9 per cent and 76.3 per cent, respectively, in the first half of this year. China has also remained Malaysia's largest trading partner for 12 consecutive years, as well as the largest foreign direct investment source in Malaysia's manufacturing sector for five consecutive years, he said. 'Our two countries have always been focusing on deepening collaborations encompassing various areas including industrial parks, infrastructure construction, equipment manufacturing, ICT (information and communications technology) and digital economy. 'The signing of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership injected new impetus into the economic development of the Asia-Pacific region, which will also bear new fields, new models and new business formats for our pragmatic cooperation. 'It will also play a prominent role in promoting economic recovery and long-term prosperity,' he said. Ouyang said China and Malaysia would further enhance cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative framework, deepen synergy between development strategies, foster new growth drivers and create new highlights in cooperation. Both countries would also leverage the advantages for further upgrading their bilateral economic cooperation, he added.

In its Monthly Economic Review, it said the recovery in domestic spending and business activities would support the gross domestic product (GDP) growth from the fourth quarter of 2021 (4Q21) onwards as confidence improved following the reopening of the economy and improving local Covid-19 situation. 'Moreover, Malaysia will continue to benefit from the growing global demand, particularly for electrical and electronics (E&E) products and commodities. 'Although the full lockdown will drag down growth in 3Q21, we expect the economy will return to a recovery path from 4Q21,' it said. MIDF Research said while it maintained its 2021 GDP growth forecast at +4.6 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y), it remained cautious that the risks to the outlook may come from the global supply chain bottlenecks, China's economic slowdown, and the uncertainties surrounding the global health crisis. Meanwhile, the research firm noted that Malaysia's leading index (LI) contracted by -2.3 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) in August 21 (July 21: -4 per cent y-o-y). The slower decline in LI signals an improvement in Malaysia's growth momentum in the near term. The downward drag in the LI reflected the reduction in the number of housing units approved during the month. Compared to the previous month, the LI rebounded and increased by +1.1 per cent month-on-month (m-o-m) against July 2021 of 0.6 per cent m-o-m, the first monthly expansion after four straight months of decline. The monthly rise was underpinned by increases in expected manufacturing sales value; Bursa Malaysia Index; real imports of other basic precious and other non-ferrous metals; and real imports of semiconductors, it said. The research firm said the improvement in the current economic conditions was reflected by the slower contraction of -1.1 per cent y-o-y in the coincident index (CI) (July 2021:  5.2 per cent y-o-y), attributable to the recovery in domestic manufacturing and consumption activities amid the easing of restrictions and transition of states to the next phases of the National Recovery Plan. It also expects the producer price index (PPI) inflation to remain elevated underpinned by the challenges from supply chain bottlenecks, logistic delays, as well as high energy and input prices. 'Not only the PPI inflation remaining above the consumer price index (CPI) inflation since January 2021, but the gap also widened in the recent months as PPI inflation accelerated further vis--vis a more stable CPI inflation.

'The performance of foreign trade has been more robust than expected and this will contribute positively to the economic recovery in the fourth quarter of the calendar year 2021 (Q4CY21). 'While Malaysia stands to benefit from the sustained growth in external demand, the slowdown in China and tighter Covid-19 restrictions in other countries are among the risks that could affect exports outlook,' it said in a research note today. MIDF Investment Bank said it is expecting exports to grow in the coming months driven by strong demand for electrical and electronics (E&E), petroleum and palm oil products. Going forward, the investment bank said it also foresaw further expansion in imports given the growing domestic spending and improving business activity. On the November 2021 performance, MIDF Investment Bank said the total trade rose to a new record high, growing grew further by 34.9 per cent to RM205.5 billion year-on-year (y-o-y) following sustained expansion in both exports and imports. It said exports growth strengthened further to 32.4 per cent y-o-y underpinned by robust external demand from Asean, the United States and European countries. The investment bank said based on sector breakdown, exports of manufactured goods rose further by 28.2 per cent y-o-y.

Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank) group president and chief executive officer Datuk Seri Abdul Farid Alias said the industry was faced with a downward trend of interest rate since the global financial crisis in 2008 and now with the effect of the pandemic and pro-growth policy, banks were expected to support economic recovery. 'The banking industry therefore still experienced compressed interest margin although it may change soon as the inflationary rate is rising. 'But for the meantime, banks need to diversify revenue stream, to balance the mix of interest income and fee-based income,' he said during a tech talk session at the virtual MyFintech Week 2022 today themed Towards a Renewed Financial Landscape. He also noted that on the geopolitical decoupling front, the world continued to see the rise of China as an economic and technology super power challenging the status quo. With US-China tension expected to continue, he said the market saw an increase in foreign direct investment in Asean-6 as companies shifted to diversify their products and supply chain. 'This would have a future impact on global demand, international trade and investment and geopolitical dynamics,' he said. On another note, he said the rise in digital economy is also changing the financial landscape with Asean becoming the fastest-growing Internet economy of the world which saw 60 million new digital consumers since the pandemic, led by Thailand and the Philippines. 'About 80 per cent of Asean Internet users are digital consumers on e-commerce, travel, media, transport and food platform driving the region digital online spending growth by 49 per cent in 2021 to US$274 billion (RM1.1 trillion). 'Therefore, companies now are changing shape as they transform to stay relevant to adopt hybrid working environment. We saw a boom in digital players, using new business model and can only expect more innovation and disruption moving forward. 'We are living in a world more complex now, where change happened more quickly and, at the same time, noisily. Some would succeed and many would fail and we just do not know which one will yet,' he said. At Maybank, Abdul Farid said the bank was lucky as the predecessors had laid a strong foundation in adopting new technology, more than 20 years ago driven by the ambition of making banking accessible to all with their computerisation initiatives, phone banking and maybank2u apps. He also noted that technological disruption in the banking industry had motivated Maybank to drive for professional efficiency, customer centricity and customer acquisition. 'As a bank, our assignment is to make use of technological advancement in optimising our operation and deepening and expanding our reach. 'I believed we all have a role to play in helping the economy and community to progress. Technology can help all of us to do a better job in reducing poverty and income inequality and protecting the environment and communities.

In the statement of claim, Low, commonly known as Jho Low, asserted that he had held no official post in the state investment firm or any of its subsidiaries. The statement was in response to a civil action launched against him and a few others by 1MDB, which accused them of criminal manipulation that led to the embezzlement of billions of ringgit. The statement of defence was filed on January 26 at the Kuala Lumpur High Court through Low's law firm Valen, Oh & Partners. Low was among several individuals and entities targeted by over 20 civil actions by 1MDB and its former subsidiary SRC International filed last year. The suits were aimed at those who allegedly defrauded the two government-owned entities, whether knowingly or unknowingly. Low was named as the primary defendant alongside five others  his father and mother Tan Sri Low Hock Peng and Goh Gaik Ewe, his sister May Lin, his younger brother Taek Szen, and his alleged associate Eric Tan Kim Loong. Bernama had reported on January 5 that Low and his parents entered an appearance in the suit through their lawyers. According to the statement of defence, Low claimed that the lawsuit should be dismissed on the grounds that it had failed to disclose a reasonable cause of action over allegation of breach of trust or fiduciary duty. The fugitive contended that he has never been a director or shareholder in 1MDB or its four subsidiaries, nor was he a member of the sovereign wealth fund's board of advisors or a part of the management team of any of the plaintiffs. 'As such, the first defendant (Jho Low) has no legal standing to exercise control over the plaintiffs, including but not limited to directing or otherwise causing the alleged transfer and/or receipt of funds,' Low was quoted as saying. Between 2019 and last year, it was reported that the US Department of Justice had repatriated billions of embezzled 1MDB money back to Malaysia. 1MDB's suit against Low and the other five defendants

Datuk Seri Jeffrey Kitingan. Its secretary-general Datuk Loretto Padua Jr said that he made the report as 'a diligent citizen' because of the secretive and suspicious nature surrounding the signing of the deal, called the Nature Conservation Agreement (NCA). 'There are a lot of contradictions and question marks that need to be looked into deeper by the necessary authorities. This includes the appointment of a third party with no apparent background and experience in the carbon credit field, and the nature of the relationship between the individuals involved in the deal,' he said. He said that he was making the report in the interests of both state and country. 'We do not want this to turn into another big scandal for the country that will embarrass us in the eyes of the world,' he said. Padua explained that the issue, involving a 70:30 income revenue sharing between the Sabah government and Singapore-based firm Hoch Standard Pte Ltd, had been published in international news site Al Jazeera on February 2. The agreement ostensibly involved between 600,000 hectares, up of two million hectares of Sabah forests earmarked for carbon trading for 100 years. The deal, inked at the end of October last year, was said to be witnessed by Sabah Chief Minister Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor, Kitingan and the state attorney general Datuk Nor Asiah Mohd Yusof. Chief Conservator of Forests Datuk Frederick Kugan signed on behalf of the state government while Hoch Standard's global corporate adviser Stan Golokin signed for the other party. However, amidst pushback from conservation and native interest groups, Hajiji had in December said that the deal would not proceed until the company had fulfilled all the requirements needed.",

of 2021. Total gross investment income for the second quarter (Q2) was, however, lower at RM14.77 billion against the RM15.12 billion recorded in the same quarter last year, the retirement fund said. Chief executive officer Datuk Seri Amir Hamzah Azizan said the EPF delivered a resilient performance in H1 2021 driven by the progressive recovery of the equity markets and most asset classes amid the global rebound. 'Equities continued to be the main contributor of income for Q2 2021 at RM7.89 billion, accounting for 53 per cent of total gross investment income,' he said in a statement today. During the quarter, a total of RM0.21 billion was written down for listed equities compared to RM1.66 billion in Q2 2020 following the continued recovery across global markets. The cost write-downs are part of the fund's internal policy to ensure a healthy portfolio. The EPF said after netting off these write-downs, the EPF recorded a total of RM14.56 billion of investment income in the quarter, up eight per cent from RM13.46 billion a year earlier. Fixed income instruments contributed RM5.28 billion or 36 per cent to the gross investment income in Q2 2021, down from the RM6.17 billion recorded in Q2 2020 due to lower trading gains. According to the EPF, its diversification into different asset classes, markets and currencies continued to provide income stability and added value to the fund's overall return. As at end-June, its investment assets stood at RM989.14 billion, of which 37 per cent was invested overseas. On i-Sinar and i-Citra facilities, the EPF has to date disbursed of a total of RM67.6 billion to assist members affected by the pandemic. On the outlook for the remaining half of the year, Amir Hamzah said the country's recovery prospects are dependent on how the Covid-19 situation plays out in the near term. 'While we are confident that the government's various stimulus packages and initiatives will keep business sentiment strong and boost domestic demand, we are very concerned about the retirement security of the people, especially with 46 per cent of EPF members below the age of 55 having less than RM10,000 in their account. 'The pandemic has led to a significant drop in the percentage of members meeting the basic savings threshold (RM240,000 at age 55) from 36 per cent to 27 per cent, pursuant to the Covid-19-related withdrawals to supplement their income during the crisis,' he said. He noted that the pandemic has also triggered a dramatic rise in the number of gig workers in the country. 'While that has helped workers survive, many of these workers are falling back on their retirement security due to the irregular and unstable income. 'Additionally, they are facing vulnerabilities in terms of employees' benefits and coverage on social protection,' he said. Amir Hamzah said the key element of the EPF's strategy going forward is to get the gig workers, as well as those in the informal sectors, into its scheme so they can start to save as early as possible and plan for their retirement.", "entities": [{"id": 1564, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 12}}, {"id": 1565, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 51}}, {"id": 1566, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 55, "end_offset": 58}}, {"id": 1567, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 356, "end_offset": 379}}, {"id": 1568, "label": "TITLE", "position": {"start_offset": 380, "end_offset": 390}}, {"id": 1569, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 419, "end_offset": 422}}, {"id": 1570, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1025, "end_offset": 1028}}, {"id": 1571, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1075, "end_offset": 1078}}, {"id": 1572, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1411, "end_offset": 1414}}, {"id": 1573, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1721, "end_offset": 1724}}, {"id": 1575, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1871, "end_offset": 1882}}, {"id": 1576, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 2242, "end_offset": 2245}}, {"id": 1579, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 2964, "end_offset": 2975}}, {"id": 1580, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 3004, "end_offset": 3007}}, {"id": 1581, "label": "PRODUCT", "position": {"start_offset": 1697, "end_offset": 1704}}, {"id": 1582, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 380, "end_offset": 409}}, {"id": 1583, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 391, "end_offset": 409}}, {"id": 1584, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 356, "end_offset": 409}}, {"id": 1585, "label": "PRODUCT", "position": {"start_offset": 1685, "end_offset": 1692}}], "relations": [{"id": 856, "head": 1583, "tail": 1568, "relation": "award received", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 857, "head": 1583, "tail": 1567, "relation": "occupation", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 858, "head": 1583, "tail": 1565, "relation": "chief executive officer", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 859, "head": 1565, "tail": 1566, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 860, "head": 1565, "tail": 1569, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 861, "head": 1565, "tail": 1571, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 862, "head": 1565, "tail": 1570, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 863, "head": 1565, "tail": 1572, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 864, "head": 1565, "tail": 1573, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 865, "head": 1565, "tail": 1576, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 866, "head": 1565, "tail": 1580, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 867, "head": 1583, "tail": 1575, "relation": "given name", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 868, "head": 1583, "tail": 1579, "relation": "given name", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1491, "head": 1573, "tail": 1585, "relation": "developer", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1492, "head": 1573, "tail": 1581, "relation": "developer", "relation_source": "DocRED"}]}, {"id": "article_284", "text": "IF  there ever is a perfect time for men's doubles Aaron Chia-Soh Wooi Yik to end their Open title wait, now is the time.

any problem  doing so as long as they test negative for Covid-19. Yesterday, the national body confirmed that six players tested positive and are already in isolation, away from the rest of the shuttlers and coaches at the Academy Badminton Malaysia (ABM) in Bukit Kiara. Pending a review tomorrow, training has been brought to a halt. But BAM are confident that quarantine-based training could resume soon. BAM secretary-general Datuk Kenny Goh told Timesport that swift actions have been taken to contain the spread of the virus. 'I believe once the self-isolation period is over, and if players test negative, there should be no problem for them to travel and compete. As long as we follow the standard operating procedures strictly, it should be fine. 'We needed to take swift actions to contain the spread,' said Kenny. It is learnt that the six players did not contract the virus from any of the tournaments they had competed in. The national shuttlers had played in three back-to-back tournaments in January in Bangkok, the Swiss Open, All England, Orleans Masters and Polish Open last month. For the elite players and those bound for the Tokyo Olympics in July, their next assignment is the India Open on May 11-16. The India Open is also an Olympic qualifying event. For some of the backup and 10 junior players, they will travel to Europe for the Slovenia International Series on May 19-22 and the Austrian Open on May 27-30.

The first phase of development entails the right to plant oil palm, rubber trees, fruit trees or forest trees with higher yields, while phase two is to develop the land into a mixed development project. MMSB, representing a group of individual landowners, has 30 years of land rights, with an option to extend for an additional fifteen years. SNC managing director Emily Sow Mei Chet said under the first phase, this joint venture will establish a sustainable aquaponics solar farm on it while the mixed development in the second phase consists of residential, commercial and industrial buildings. According to Emily, the project consists of three components, namely aquaponics farm, which combines aquaculture with hydroponics farming, the solar photovoltaic energy generation facility with a capacity of up to 100MW and the setting-up of a dedicated agro-tourism centre that is complete with farm, fruit orchard and marketplace. The total land available in the area is around 500 acres, of which SNC has secured about 162 acres with this JV. Emily noted that the untapped lands provide an excellent opportunity for SNC to enlarge the company's total land acreage in the future. 'It is a very strategic move for SNC as we can lock in the greenfield land earlier and still enjoy the benefits from the land's cultivation into brownfield agriculture land before the final conversion into a mixed development project. 'Given the strategic location of the land, which is accessible within 20 minutes to the Simpang Ampat Highway to Kuala Lumpur, 15 minutes drive to Alor Gajah, 15 minutes drive to Taman Cheng, and 15 to 20 minutes drive to Malacca town,' Emily said in a statement. From the environmental, social and governance (ESG) perspective, the joint venture project offers a good opportunity for SNC to reduce its carbon footprint. She said the aquaponics farm and agro-tourism centre is also expected to open doors for jobs and encourage entrepreneurship, especially among the local communities, as it attracts more foreign tourists into the area. On top of that, SNC's involvement in the agriculture business also allows the company to contribute to national food security, in line with the country's National Agrofood Policy 2021-2030. The project is expected to bring long-term earnings visibility for SNC and ensure financial stability for the company. SNC intends to fund the project via a combination of internally generated funds, bank borrowings, and other fund-raising exercises for the company and its subsidiaries.

Elsewhere, geopolitical tension surrounding Russia exerted additional downside pressure on equity markets globally.

The state Immunisation Task Force director Datuk Shahelmey Yahya said the authorities were aware there have been attempts to discourage people from taking boosters and child vaccines.   'They are doing it by spreading stories on the side effects after booster shots, though not backed by scientific data and proof.   'On the other hand, I notice the real reason why the status of booster shots is still low is because there is an option.   'Some people could be complacent due to that. But I hope many will realise the importance of getting boosted after a certain period of time,' he told the New Straits Times.   According to the Health Ministry's Covidnow website, only 21 percent of 2,103,971 fully vaccinated adults received their boosters.   For children aged between 5 and 11 in Sabah, only 13,650 or 3.3 per cent of eligible recipients received the vaccines.   This week, there were 1,829 cases involving young children or 7.7 per cent of the total Covid-19 weekly cases.   'We hope our community will be more aware and realise the need to get booster shots and child vaccinations as the current infection rate in the state has gone higher.   'Awareness programmes are also being conducted in Sabah every day through the Jabatan Kesihatan Negeri Sabah Facebook and RTM Sabah.'   The programme has since been extended throughout the state with the setting up of 145 vaccine administering centres (PPV) involving 109 health clinics, 22 hospitals, 18 private clinics and four public PPVs, monitored by specialists and medical officers.   Shahelmey, who is also the state Community Development and People's Wellbeing chairman, said these facilities also allow walk-in services.   As for the outreach programme, he said the state health department is working with the state government on various outreach vaccinations by setting up temporary centres at community halls or government offices.   The PICKids vaccination programme, which will be held at 1,705 primary schools, is also aimed at ensuring parents, including in the interior, bring their children to get the first dose of vaccine, to increase the vaccination rates.   Although some schools will have the abrupt closure due to Covid-19 cases, he said the programmes would be continued until March.", "entities": [{"id": 1808, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 13}}, {"id": 1809, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 20}}, {"id": 1810, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 153, "end_offset": 161}}, {"id": 1811, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 162, "end_offset": 183}}, {"id": 1812, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 713, "end_offset": 730}}, {"id": 1813, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 751, "end_offset": 766}}, {"id": 1814, "label": "PRODUCT", "position": {"start_offset": 769, "end_offset": 785}}, {"id": 1815, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 905, "end_offset": 910}}, {"id": 1816, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1320, "end_offset": 1325}}, {"id": 1817, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1392, "end_offset": 1401}}, {"id": 1818, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1662, "end_offset": 1671}}, {"id": 1819, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 1695, "end_offset": 1748}}, {"id": 1820, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 129, "end_offset": 152}}, {"id": 1821, "label": "TITLE", "position": {"start_offset": 162, "end_offset": 167}}, {"id": 1822, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 168, "end_offset": 183}}, {"id": 1823, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 153, "end_offset": 183}}, {"id": 1824, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 129, "end_offset": 183}}, {"id": 2861, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1348, "end_offset": 1378}}], "relations": [{"id": 962, "head": 1808, "tail": 1809, "relation": "Part-Whole.Geo", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 963, "head": 1822, "tail": 1821, "relation": "award received", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 964, "head": 1822, "tail": 1810, "relation": "occupation", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 965, "head": 1822, "tail": 1820, "relation": "Org-Aff.Membership", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 966, "head": 1822, "tail": 1820, "relation": "director / manager", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 967, "head": 1813, "tail": 1814, "relation": "developer", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 968, "head": 1813, "tail": 1814, "relation": "operator", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 969, "head": 1822, "tail": 1818, "relation": "given name", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 970, "head": 2861, "tail": 1816, "relation": "Gen-Aff.Loc-Origin", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 972, "head": 1822, "tail": 1819, "relation": "occupation", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 971, "head": 1817, "tail": 1816, "relation": "Gen-Aff.Loc-Origin", "relation_source": "ACE05"}]}, {"id": "article_293", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: With only four Super League rounds to go, Johor Darul Ta'zim (JDT) are expected to retain their crown for the eighth straight time.

Meanwhile, he refused to comment on his appointment which has been linked to his brother Kevin Ramalingam, who is the former CEO of MFL and is now active in the local football industry with reigning Super League champions Johor Darul Ta'zim (JDT). He said although they both share the same surname they are both different individuals with different abilities. 'Whatever that he has done to establish MFL, to create the product that it is today, I wouldn't be able to have done that, so all credit to him, to have evolved from association-based football to a private entity like MFL. 'I truly appreciate all the work he has done when he was at the MFL because the fundamental foundation work of what he has done is a thing that I may have not been able to deliver. However, I think maybe now as the vehicle is running, I can improve it moving forward,' he added. Kevin who was the CEO of The Red Warriors Sdn Bhd before becoming CEO of Football Malaysia Limited Liability Partnership (now known as MFL) in April 2015, resigned from the post in November 2019. In the meantime, Stuart asked for some time to get to know the whole of MFL before he finalises the mission and vision, as well as its direction.", "entities": [{"id": 1848, "label": "LOCATION",

will lead a discussion session at the technical level to refine the proposed implementation of the Melaka Waterfront Economic Zone (M-WEZ) under the 12th Malaysia Plan (12MP). Minister in the Prime Minister's Department (Economy) Datuk Seri Mustapa Mohamed made the matter a priority following the Melaka state government's application to consider the implementation of M-WEZ as Melaka is currently not included in any economic corridor. 'The Melaka government has requested that attention be given to the M-WEZ proposal which has already been presented to the National Physical Planning Council (MPFN). The EPU will hold discussions at the technical level before going to a higher level. 'This proposal has been presented to me and the Prime Minister (Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob) has also been informed. Only in terms of the implementation of this concept we will refine further,' he told reporters after attending a session on the 12MP with the Melaka state government here. Mustapa said that among other things requested by the Melaka government through the 12MP was for the federal government to consider the construction of a 52km coastal highway in the state. 'The Melaka government has stated their intention for this application to be considered because it has not been listed in the First and Second Rolling Plans of the 12MP,' he said. Meanwhile, Melaka Chief Minister Datuk Seri Sulaiman Md Ali said through the 12MP, the state government had applied for an allocation of RM10 billion from the federal government to ensure various projects in the state are successful. 'However, the actual amount that will be approved by the federal government is based on priority. The federal government will review how much can be assisted,' he said. Sulaiman said the total allocation received by Melaka through the first and second Rolling Plans of the 12MP is about RM1 billion so far and the allocation for other projects will be included in the next Rolling Plan. Earlier in the 12MP engagement session, Mustapa assured that emphasis would be given to efforts to address poverty and strengthen inclusiveness as well as achieve a decent standard of living. Apart from that, he said the tourism sector in Melaka would also be given attention through the 12MP as it is the main economic sector in the state.", "entities": [{"id": 1894, "label": "LOCATION",

to 300 candidates vying for seats. In a statement today, the Iskandar Puteri MP pointed to several recently-formed political parties which may signify those trying to profit from the current political turmoil in the country. 'Malaysia is in the most chaotic and confused political state, and many think this is time for them to act and for soldiers of fortune to believe they have an opportunity to strike gold,' he said. 'Many political parties have been formed or expanded recently but how many of them are by people of intense beliefs and ideals, and who are prepared to put national and state vision above personal interests? 'Time will tell but I believe that 'political frogs' and 'political poachers' do not belong to those who are prepared to put national interest above self-interest and do not belong to those with intense beliefs and ideals and vision,' he said. Lim had also pointed to recent state elections with their numerous candidates: 447 candidates for 73 seats in Sabah (a ratio of 6.1 candidates to one seat), in Melaka with 112 candidates for 29 seats (4:1), and Sarawak with 349 candidates for 82 seats (4.3:1). Commenting on the loss of deposits in recent state elections with as many as 65.1 per cent of candidates in Sabah, Lim urged for the number of candidates to be cut down so voters can make a clearer decision. 'There is no purpose to be like political parties which fielded double-digit number of candidates but lose deposits on all their candidates or fielded over 70 candidates but over 90 per cent of its candidates lost their deposits,' he said. Previously, Johor DAP chief Liew Chin Tong had urged the state's voters to be the spark that would set off a national reset, as he called on them to support both state and federal reform by voting for Pakatan Harapan and its allies. Four days ago, Johor Ruler Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar gave his royal assent to the dissolution of the Johor state legislative assembly, paving the way for an early state election. Caretaker Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Hasni Mohammad leads the state government with a razor-thin majority of 28 seats. BN holds 16 seats while Bersatu has 11 seats and PAS one. The opposition Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition controls 27 seats in the Johor state assembly comprising DAP with 14, Parti Amanah Negara (six) and PKR (seven).", "entities": [{"id": 1933, "label":

modern-day slaves. The diplomat told news portal Free Malaysia Today (FMT) that Indonesians who were employed in similar positions in other countries like Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan did not undergo as much mistreatment as in Malaysia. Hermono told the news portal that there were many cases of Indonesian maids who were made to work for years unpaid for their labour as well as those who had their identification papers taken away by the employers. He also recounted Indonesians who worked long hours without rest days and those who underwent physical abuse. Hermono said a recent case involved an employer who justified not paying a salary to a maid for around 10 years by saying she was allowed to live at their house and that they were paying for her food. 'That's an example of modern-day slavery or forced labour.' 'We have domestic workers in Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan, but we don't have serious problems like here (in Malaysia). So why do we have these problems here?' he told FMT. Hermono said the Indonesian embassy had last year helped in 206 cases with employers paying off more than RM2 million and that over 40 cases are now in the courts, with the Indonesian embassy having also in just this year assisted 16 maids and helped in getting more than RM300,000 in unpaid salaries returned to them. He noted that maids are more likely to face abuse in comparison to other migrant workers, as maids work alone and live in their employers' residence, also saying that such Indonesian maids either could not flee from their employers or have challenges in informing the embassy or consulate-general. 'They're warned that if they run away, the police will catch them and the immigration will send them to their depot. These kinds of threats are pure elements of forced labour,' he was quoted saying. Malaysia and Indonesia are currently in talks for a new worker deal. Hermono envisions the new deal will better protect Indonesians employed as domestic workers in a one-channel system that will enable his country's government to keep tabs on them during their employment here. The diplomat also alluded to proposals for an online salary system that will enable Jakarta to see if the Indonesian workers receive their due salaries. 'If they miss even one month [of paying a worker's salary], we can contact the employers through the agency and ask them why they haven't paid,' he was quoted saying.", "entities": [{"id": 1977, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 12}}, {"id": 1978, "label": "NORP", "position": {"start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 32}}, {"id": 1979, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 51}}, {"id": 1980, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 55, "end_offset": 63}}, {"id": 1981, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 175, "end_offset": 183}}, {"id": 1982, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 201, "end_offset": 220}}, {"id": 1983, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 222, "end_offset": 225}}, {"id": 1984, "label": "NORP", "position": {"start_offset": 232, "end_offset": 243}}, {"id": 1985, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 307, "end_offset": 316}}, {"id": 1986, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 318, "end_offset": 327}}, {"id": 1987, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 332, "end_offset": 338}}, {"id": 1988, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 382, "end_offset": 390}}, {"id": 1989, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 392, "end_offset": 399}}, {"id": 1990, "label": "NORP", "position": {"start_offset": 451, "end_offset": 461}}, {"id": 1991, "label": "NORP", "position": {"start_offset": 624, "end_offset": 635}}, {"id": 1992, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 716, "end_offset": 723}}, {"id": 1993, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1006, "end_offset": 1015}}, {"id": 1994, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1017, "end_offset": 1026}}, {"id": 1995, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1031, "end_offset": 1037}}, {"id": 1996, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1088, "end_offset": 1096}}, {"id": 1997, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1147, "end_offset": 1150}}, {"id": 1998, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1152, "end_offset": 1159}}, {"id": 1999, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1169, "end_offset": 1187}}, {"id": 2000, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1325, "end_offset": 1343}}, {"id": 2001, "label": "NORP", "position": {"start_offset": 1643, "end_offset": 1653}}, {"id": 2002, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 1750, "end_offset": 1767}}, {"id": 2003, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1968, "end_offset": 1976}}, {"id": 2004, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1981, "end_offset": 1990}}, {"id": 2005, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 2037, "end_offset": 2044}}, {"id": 2006, "label": "NORP", "position": {"start_offset": 2088, "end_offset": 2099}}, {"id": 2007, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 2250, "end_offset": 2258}}, {"id": 2008, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 2330, "end_offset": 2337}}, {"id": 2009, "label": "NORP", "position": {"start_offset": 2352, "end_offset": 2362}}, {"id": 2010, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 51}}, {"id": 2011, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 43}}], "relations": [{"id": 1477, "head": 2010, "tail": 2011, "relation": "occupation", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1476, "head": 1982, "tail": 1983, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1478, "head": 2010, "tail": 1978, "relation": "ethnic group", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1479, "head": 2010, "tail": 1981, "relation": "occupation", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1480, "head": 2010, "tail": 1989, "relation": "given name", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1481, "head": 2010, "tail": 1992, "relation": "given name", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1482, "head": 2010, "tail": 1998, "relation": "given name", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1483, "head": 2010, "tail": 2005, "relation": "given name", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1484, "head": 2010, "tail": 2007, "relation": "occupation", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1486, "head": 1982, "tail": 1997, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1485, "head": 2008, "tail": 2009, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1487, "head": 2003, "tail": 2004, "relation": "partnership with", "relation_source": "DocRED"}]}, {"id": "article_298", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 20  The ringgit rebounded to open higher versus the US dollar today, as the greenback retreated amid risk-on mode in the equity market, an analyst said. At 9.05am, the local currency was trading at 4.1855/1880 against the US dollar compared with 4.1925/1950 at yesterday's close. Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd chief economist Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid told Bernama that the 10-year US Treasury yielded lower at 1.83 per cent last night, while major US equities benchmark index fell. It seems at the moment, the US dollar/ringgit is hovering slightly below its immediate resistant level of RM4.1958. Mohd Afzanizam said market participants are expected to pay close attention to Bank Negara Malaysia's (BNM) Monetary Policy Committee meeting deliberation today. 'Most economists expect no change in the present overnight policy rate (OPR) level of 1.75 per cent,' he said. He said while that could be already in the price, the markets would want to see the committee's assessment on the prevailing economic condition, in particular the inflation, and how it might affect the monetary policy going forward. 'As such, expect the local note to be in a tight range today,' he added. At the opening bell, the local note was traded mixed against a basket of other major currencies.

In a statement today, the company said the restructuring exercise also includes the appointment of a few key management personnel as heads of region where the global integrated oil and gas (O&G) service provider has a strong presence. Serba Dinamik said this was following a realignment exercise of the group's organisational chart to ensure a more effective global operation which would enable the group to continue delivering its shareholders mandate. 'These heads of region will report directly to Mohamed Ackiel and the restructuring will also lead to the appointment of new faces to helm the corporate communications and stakeholder relations position,' it said. Prior to this, Mohamed Ackiel was the company's senior vice-president (special projects), where he was leading the companies digital transformation and several key initiatives and projects in the Middle East, Central Asia, and Americas. With a combined industry and academic experience of over 18 years, he was also the deputy chairman of the board of governors for University Malaysia of Computer Science and Engineering (UNIMY), a higher learning institution wholly owned by Serba Dinamik. Meanwhile, since its inception in 1996, Serba Dinamik has expanded to more than 25 countries. With the new structure, the group aims to further solidify its foothold in O&G, engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning, as well as information and technology (IT) businesses through its strong geographical presence. More focus would also be given to overseas operations and territory expansion for global growth, however, there is no change in the company's head of finance with Azhan Azmi remaining as group chief financial officer (CFO). Serba Dinamik's founder Datuk Dr Mohd Abdul Karim Abdullah would remain as group managing director and CEO where he would oversee the entire operations both domestically and internationally. 'In essence, the new organisational structure encompasses both the domestic and global businesses with the ultimate aim of strengthening Serba Dinamik's business offerings to its clients, in addition to improving the group's internal control and governance,' the company said. As of Sept 30, 2021, Serba Dinamik has a workforce of 2,926 comprising permanent, long-term and contract employees (project basis) for both its domestic and international operations.

The company said the task force was established to explore new trends and opportunities for growth in the automotive sector, particularly in shared mobility and the industry's electrification. 'As part of this mobility strategy, Sime Darby has invested RM42 million to date in mobility players,' it said in a statement. Group chief executive officer Datuk Jeffri Salim Davidson said the company acknowledges the evolution in the industry and is taking dynamic steps to future-proof its motors business. 'We have developed a mobility strategy as part of our efforts to revolutionise and transform our Motors division to be ready for the future of automotive. 'Our thrust into mobility is our Engine Two to Sime Darby Motors' Engine One, which we are continuing to fortify to its full potential,' said Jeffri. Engine One refers to the company's existing motors business which it is strengthening, while Engine Two relates to its future-focused strategies to capitalise on new mobility trends.

With EVs transforming the automotive landscape, Sime Darby aims to capitalise on its many strengths along the value chain to become the leading EV specialist in the region. Sime Darby's recent investment of RM42 million in car-sharing company SOCAR and online used car platform CARRO demonstrates its ambitions to expand mobility. 'These investments are critical in growing our business beyond the traditional dealerships and in embracing alternative ownership models, as well as to capitalise on the solid growth potential in the car-sharing industry in the region. 'Our investments in these start-ups are strategic and symbiotic, and they come after we have spent the last year or two in collaboration on several fronts to see how we can leverage on each other's strengths,' said Jeffri. Meanwhile, group chief strategy officer Datuk Thomas Leong said as one of the leading automotive players in the Asia Pacific region, the company is taking on a more active and dynamic role in the transformation of the mobility industry. 'We remain on the lookout for more exciting investments and collaborative opportunities with other strategic partners to help us 'see ahead' into the future,' said Leong.

'The GDP growth achieved last year is in line with our expectations which is between 3.0 per cent and 4.0 per cent, which clearly shows an improvement in the economy's momentum,' he told reporters after visiting Penang's Urban Transformation Centre (UTC) here today. Tengku Zafrul said the RM50 billion FDI achieved for 2021, which is higher than previous years, also signalled that foreign investors are still confident in Malaysia's economic prospects. In 2020, Malaysia's FDI recorded a net inflow of RM14.6 billion, a 54.8 per cent decrease compared with RM32.4 billion in 2019. 'This momentum is expected to continue, hence, the government still expects GDP to grow at the rate of 5.5 to 6.5 per cent this year. If there is a new projection, it will be announced in March. 'The only downside is the Covid-19 Omicron wave but it's not as dangerous as the Delta,' he said. Meanwhile, the minister said the government is also looking at tabling a supplementary budget this year when Parliament convenes. 'We do not know the size of the budget yet but the focus will be to ensure our economy recovers and to help the vulnerable groups like the flood victims and traders. 'The prime minister himself had announced additional aid to those affected by the recent floods, as well as the farmers and the micro and small and medium entrepreneurs,' he added.", "entities": [{"id": 3749, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 228, "end_offset": 252}}, {"id": 3750, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 200, "end_offset": 252}}, {"id": 3751, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 217, "end_offset": 252}}, {"id": 3752, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 11}}, {"id": 3753, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 180, "end_offset": 188}}, {"id": 3754, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 200, "end_offset": 216}}, {"id": 3755, "label": "TITLE", "position": {"start_offset": 217, "end_offset": 227}}, {"id": 3756, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 320, "end_offset": 328}}, {"id": 3757, "label": "FACILITY", "position": {"start_offset": 672, "end_offset": 708}}, {"id": 3758, "label": "FACILITY", "position": {"start_offset": 710, "end_offset": 713}}, {"id": 3759, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 727, "end_offset": 740}}, {"id": 3760, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 884, "end_offset": 892}}, {"id": 3761, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 924, "end_offset": 932}}, {"id": 3762, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1319, "end_offset": 1324}}, {"id": 3763, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 1351, "end_offset": 1359}}, {"id": 3764, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1445, "end_offset": 1455}}, {"id": 3765, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 1637, "end_offset": 1651}}], "relations": [{"id": 2010, "head": 3757, "tail": 3758, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2011, "head": 3749, "tail": 3755, "relation": "award received", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2012, "head": 3751, "tail": 3754, "relation": "occupation", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2013, "head": 3749, "tail": 3759, "relation": "given name", "relation_source": "DocRED"}]}, {"id": "article_304", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 7  Several PKR Members of Parliament (MPs) today lodged a police report against Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) chief commissioner Tan Sri Azam Baki following his admission that his younger brother had used his securities account to acquire shares in several companies.

Fahmi said Azam should also be temporarily relieved of his post until the investigation was completed. 'If the investigation proves that he did not commit any wrongdoing, he can continue serving,' he added. Fahmi also wanted investigations to be conducted by a third party or an independent body like Parliament or Royal Commission of Inquiry. Meanwhile, Akmal Nasrullah said police should also investigate the source of funds used by Azam's brother for the share purchase. Earlier, reports had gone viral on social media alleging that Azam owned a substantial amount of shares in several companies. Azam, in a press conference on Wednesday, said he had explained to the Anti-Corruption Advisory Board (LPPR) that his share account had been used by his brother to buy shares in the open market with the latter's own financing. The Securities Commission (SC), in a statement yesterday, said it would seek clarification from Azam and also gather evidence on the use of his share trading account by his brother Nasir to buy shares in 2015.

keep their plants watered while away on long vacations. Suthiksha Baloo, 12, and her brother Narashimma Naidu Baloo, 10, had invented a Bluetooth-based plant-watering system that enabled users to water their plants remotely via smart devices. In fact, the duo from SK Taman Megah aimed to expand their system's wireless connections to include Wi-Fi services. If successful, the system would allow users to water their plants at home from anywhere  in the country. Suthiksha and Narashimma's smart plant-watering system was also suitable to irrigate crops in small and medium-sized farms. Their innovative invention bagged the gold medal at the Asian Innovative Science, Environmental and Entrepreneur Fair,  which was held in Semarang, Indonesia, from Feb 2 -5. Their smart irrigation system clinched the top prize, defeating 447 participants and teams from 20 countries. Their mother, Rajeswari Narasingam, 51, said her children developed interest for innovations after they started attending classes on the Internet of Things (IoT) that was designed for young children in 2020. 'Honestly, IoT is Greek to me. So, at first, I was afraid my children might get bored over the technical skills taught in the classes. But, they gradually gained confidence and became more enthusiastic to invent and innovate. 'In the last two years, Suthiksha and Narashimma have won 11 gold, three silver and four bronze medals at innovation competitions that were held virtually in  India, Turkey and Nigeria,' she told the New Straits Times. Rajeswari saidthe Malaysia Innovation, Invention and Creativity Association (MIICA) played a pivotal role in encouraging her children to promote their inventions on international platforms. 'During the early stages of their project, MIICA evaluated Suthiksha and Narashimma's work, offered constructive inputs and challenged them to develop world-class innovations. 'Due to their inputs, some judges even commended the smart plant-watering system as 'equivalent to a doctorate (PhD) project' that led them to win the gold medal,' she said.", "entities": [{"id": 3861, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 12}}, {"id": 3862, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 42}}, {"id": 3863, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 136, "end_offset": 151}}, {"id": 3864, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 173, "end_offset": 195}}, {"id": 3865, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 345, "end_offset": 359}}, {"id": 3866, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 544, "end_offset": 553}}, {"id": 3867, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 558, "end_offset": 568}}, {"id": 3868, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 724, "end_offset": 785}}, {"id": 3869, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 806, "end_offset": 814}}, {"id": 3870, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 816, "end_offset": 825}}, {"id": 3871, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 966, "end_offset": 986}}, {"id": 3872, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1410, "end_offset": 1419}}, {"id": 3873, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1424, "end_offset": 1434}}, {"id": 3874, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1545, "end_offset": 1550}}, {"id": 3875, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1552, "end_offset": 1558}}, {"id": 3876, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1563, "end_offset": 1570}}, {"id": 3877, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1586, "end_offset": 1603}}, {"id": 3878, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1605, "end_offset": 1614}}, {"id": 3879, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1623, "end_offset": 1680}}, {"id": 3880, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1682, "end_offset": 1687}}, {"id": 3881, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1838, "end_offset": 1843}}, {"id": 3882, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1854, "end_offset": 1863}}, {"id": 3883, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1868, "end_offset": 1878}}], "relations": [{"id": 1947, "head": 3869, "tail": 3870, "relation": "Part-Whole.Geo", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 1949, "head": 3864, "tail": 3871, "relation": "mother", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1946, "head": 3863, "tail": 3864, "relation": "Per-Social.Family", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 1948, "head": 3863, "tail": 3871, "relation": "mother", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1950, "head": 3863, "tail": 3871, "relation": "Per-Social.Family", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 1951, "head": 3864, "tail": 3871, "relation": "Per-Social.Family", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 1952, "head": 3871, "tail": 3878, "relation": "given name", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1954, "head": 3864, "tail": 3867, "relation": "given name", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1955, "head": 3863, "tail": 3868, "relation": "participant", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1957, "head": 3879, "tail": 3880, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1958, "head": 3863, "tail": 3864, "relation": "sibling", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1959, "head": 3871, "tail": 3863, "relation": "child", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1953, "head": 3863, "tail": 3866, "relation": "given name", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1956, "head": 3864, "tail": 3868, "relation": "participant", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1960, "head": 3871, "tail": 3864, "relation": "child", "relation_source": "DocRED"}]}, {"id": "article_307", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd's (BIMB) net profit eased 0.6 per cent to RM101.63 million in the third quarter (Q3) ended September 30, 2021, from RM102.25 million recorded in the same quarter last year. In a filing to Bursa Malaysia today, the bank said the lower net profit recorded for the quarter was due to a decrease in total revenue and an increase in total overheads. Revenue in the same quarter decreased 14.8 per cent to RM746.22 million from RM876.09 million. BIMB said gross fund-based income decreased by RM33.7 million or 4.8 per cent due to the downward revision of the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) in 2020. Non-fund based income also decreased by RM96.2 million for Q3 2021 compared to Q3 2020, mainly due to lower investment income, notably lower net gain from the sale of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income. Meanwhile, it said for Q3 2021, the banking group recorded a net allowance charged for impairment on financing and advances of RM34.0 million compared to RM155.5 million in Q3 2020. 'The lower allowance for impairment on financing and advances was mainly due to modest deterioration of assets quality as a result of various efforts from the banking group to assist customers during these challenging times such as Pemulih Repayment Assistance, targeted relief as well as giving out automatic moratorium to the affected customers,' it said. For the cumulative nine-month period, BIMB's net profit increased 17.3 per cent to RM454.67 million from RM387.74 million due to lower net allowance for impairment on financing and advances.

Group chief executive officer Syed Feizal Syed Mohammad said the opportunity to be part of the Coca-Cola supply chain, the world's most valuable soft drink brand, is part of MSM's export blueprint as the top eight global integrated sugar refiner. This was in addition to the company's existing secured term sales supply contracts with various major local fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry players locally and in the region. 'This accomplishment added a boost to MSM group having achieved a turnaround in 2021 and accelerating MSM's expansion to wider markets across the region,' he said. Syed Feizal said MSM would provide sustainable raw sugar supply for Coca-Cola domestic market as part of the company's commitment towards environmental, social and governance framework. MSM said the company had been serving Coca-Cola domestically for more than ten years. The two-year contract with Coca-Cola Bottlers (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd allows MSM to supply refined sugar between 2022 and 2023. The contract also applied for the export that commenced in December 2021, where the refined sugar supply would be shipped to a different international destination where Coca-Cola has a strong presence. MSM Prai operates the Prai sugar refinery in Penang. Located on the northwest coast of Peninsular Malaysia, the facility is the country's largest sugar refinery, with an annual production capacity of 1.05 million tonnes of refined sugar. Meanwhile, MSM Sugar Refinery (Johor) Sdn Bhd, is strategically located at Tanjung Langsat Port, Johor, with an annual production capacity of one million tonnes of refined sugar, is set to ramp up its production in 2022. MSM group observes strict quality control and standard operating procedures, and its refineries are regularly audited to maintain the highest standard of food safety and quality. MSM is capable of producing sugar according to Coca-Cola's specification which also includes JAKIM Halal Certification Standards of Malaysia, MS1500:2009, Food Safety System Certification (FSSC 22000  Manufacturing), Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) Certifications and Good Manufacturing Practices, amongst others that are relevant to the industry. MSM group offers a variety of high-quality sugar products marketed and sold in various packaging and grades to fulfil the domestic and export demand. The capability of MSM to produce the International Commission for Uniform Methods of Sugar Analysis (ICUMSA) 25 specification of refined sugar of global premium quality has established a strong

case, to be 'stubborn'. It's thanks to her dogged pursuit, or stubbornness as she calls it, that she will be making her Olympic debut in Tokyo, Japan tomorrow  eight years after suffering a ruptured right Achilles tendon injury. When she finally walks onto the court to take on Laura Sarosi of Hungary in Group N at the Musashino Forest Sport Plaza in Tokyo, tomorrow, it will be the culmination of an almost decade-long hard work, sacrifice and perseverance for the 28-year-old Soniia. And vindication of her decision to pursue her dream of playing badminton, a game which she first picked up at the tender age of 10. 'It was a stubborn decision I made eight years ago, which is (that) I am willing to give it all I have in me to make it here despite there being a lot of uncertainties as to whether it's the right or wrong decision. 'I am very lucky and grateful as I have very supportive families and friends who (have) supported this stubborn woman to allow her to chase her dream (although some feel that it's not worth it), but to me, it's worth as much as my life,' the 2018 Commonwealth Games silver medallist wrote on her Facebook page. Standing at 175cm, Soniia has undergone four surgeries related to the Achilles tendon injury since 2013, besides also having to contend with a left ankle injury during the 2019 SEA Games. Soniia, the younger sister of former national shuttler Lydia Cheah, also paid tribute to her father Cheah Kim Leng and mother Helen Low for allowing the sisters to take up badminton as a career. 'Daddy, Mummy, I wish that you both won't regret the decision of letting @lyddiacheah and me to excel in badminton, because the pain and hardship we went through are very precious and unique life experiences. 'Thank you Daddy, Mummy. If I can reverse time to choose my sports career again, I will still go for badminton,' she added. After the match against the Hungarian, Soniia will have to brace herself for an uphill task as she will be up against fifth seed Ratchanok Intanon of Thailand on Wednesday (July 28).", "entities": [{"id": 3928, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 12}}, {"id": 3929, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 95, "end_offset": 107}}, {"id": 3930, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 230, "end_offset": 237}}, {"id": 3931, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 247, "end_offset": 252}}, {"id": 3932, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 254, "end_offset": 259}}, {"id": 3933, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 388, "end_offset": 400}}, {"id": 3934, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 404, "end_offset": 411}}, {"id": 3935, "label": "FACILITY", "position": {"start_offset": 430, "end_offset": 458}}, {"id": 3936, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 462, "end_offset": 467}}, {"id": 3937, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 589, "end_offset": 595}}, {"id": 3938, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 1187, "end_offset": 1210}}, {"id": 3939, "label": "PRODUCT", "position": {"start_offset": 1241, "end_offset": 1249}}, {"id": 3940, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1275, "end_offset": 1281}}, {"id": 3941, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 1428, "end_offset": 1442}}, {"id": 3942, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1444, "end_offset": 1450}}, {"id": 3943, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1499, "end_offset": 1510}}, {"id": 3944, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1544, "end_offset": 1558}}, {"id": 3945, "label": "NORP", "position": {"start_offset": 2000, "end_offset": 2009}}, {"id": 3946, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 2011, "end_offset": 2017}}, {"id": 3947, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 2101, "end_offset": 2118}}, {"id": 3948, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 2122, "end_offset": 2130}}, {"id": 3949, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 86, "end_offset": 94}}, {"id": 3950, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 1490, "end_offset": 1498}}, {"id": 3951, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1570, "end_offset": 1579}}], "relations": [{"id": 1912, "head": 3943, "tail": 3944, "relation": "father", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1913, "head": 3943, "tail": 3951, "relation": "mother", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1916, "head": 3929, "tail": 3944, "relation": "Per-Social.Family", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 1964, "head": 3944, "tail": 3929, "relation": "child", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1965, "head": 3951, "tail": 3929, "relation": "child", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1961, "head": 3929, "tail": 3943, "relation": "sibling", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1962, "head": 3944, "tail": 3943, "relation": "child", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1963, "head": 3951, "tail": 3943, "relation": "child", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1900, "head": 3929, "tail": 3949, "relation": "occupation", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1901, "head": 3931, "tail": 3932, "relation": "Part-Whole.Geo", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 1902, "head": 3930, "tail": 3931, "relation": "location", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1903, "head": 3929, "tail": 3930, "relation": "participant", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1904, "head": 3935, "tail": 3936, "relation": "location", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1905, "head": 3933, "tail": 3934, "relation": "country for sport", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1907, "head": 3943, "tail": 3950, "relation": "occupation", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1906, "head": 3929, "tail": 3937, "relation": "given name", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1908, "head": 3943, "tail": 3929, "relation": "Per-Social.Family", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 1909, "head": 3944, "tail": 3951, "relation": "spouse", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1910, "head": 3943, "tail": 3944, "relation": "Per-Social.Family", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 1911, "head": 3943, "tail": 3951, "relation": "Per-Social.Family", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 1914, "head": 3929, "tail": 3944, "relation": "father", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1915, "head": 3929, "tail": 3951, "relation": "mother", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1917, "head": 3929, "tail": 3951, "relation": "Per-Social.Family", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 1918, "head": 3947, "tail": 3948, "relation": "country for sport", "relation_source": "DocRED"}]}, {"id": "article_310", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: VSTECS Bhd's net profit increased 54 per cent year-on-year (YoY) to RM19.82 million for the fourth quarter (Q4) ended December 31, 2021, from RM12.87 million recorded previously. In an exchange filing yesterday, the information and communications technology (ICT) company said this was attributed to contribution across all business segments including ICT distribution and ICT services divisions. Its Q4 revenue grew 15.7 per cent YoY to RM763.40 million from RM659.63 million on the back of higher sales and better product mix as IT retailers have more flexibilities to operate their business from the lockdown standard operating procedures (SOP) and higher project transactions from the public sectors. For the cumulative financial year ended December 31, 2021 (FY21), VSTECS' net profit surged 49.5 per cent to RM54.99 million from RM36.78 million, while revenue increased 30 per cent to RM2.62 billion from RM2.02 billion. VSTECS said International Data Corporation (IDC) projected a growth rate of 1.2 per cent in 2022 on ICT products compared with a growth of 7.1 per cent last year. It added the previous shortages in consumer products that caused long shipments delays for the last two years had cut into delivery lead time. 'While such shortages have abated, the high demand of notebook and tablet is also slowly reverting back to the normal volume, back to the pre-pandemic days.' VSTECS said many high-end enterprise products were facing acute component shortages since Q4 last year. 'The long shipment delays are impacting our enterprise project deployments. 'Both public sector and commercial enterprises are pushing for digital transformation to remain relevant and for better resiliency and business continuity.' On the positive side, it said demand for cloud computing and cybersecurity could surge from the pandemic aftermath. 'We are well-positioned to benefit from such opportunities.

'A nightmare for opposition defenders on the flanks, he was a member of the 1977 Malaysia Cup-winning side,' the update said. FAS noted that Mat Noh also famously scored the winning goal in the first round of World Cup qualifiers on March 6, 1977, firing home a penalty in a 1-0 win at Kallang Stadium against a strong Malaysian side regarded as one of Asia's best at the time. 'Our sincerest thoughts and deepest condolences go out to his family and loved ones during this difficult time. Earlier, the local media outlet reported that the former winger was in a critical condition at Sengkang General Hospital. Meanwhile, Singapore's veteran songbird Rahimah Rahim who was Mat Noh's wife for 11 years also expressed her sadness. 'Me and my family with deep sorrow will like to share that Mohd Noh Hussin, 67, has returned to Rahmatullah,' she wrote on her Facebook posting along with a photo of Mat Noh. The pair divorced in 1988. Mat Noh's demise also earned the attention of the republic's Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan. 'The dazzling skills of Mat Noh and his teammates left indelible memories for my generation. The Malaysia Cup was a rite of passage for so many of us. May he rest in peace,' Balakrishnan wrote on his Facebook page.", "entities": [{"id": 4004, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 9}}, {"id": 4005, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 36}}, {"id": 4006, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 57, "end_offset": 76}}, {"id": 4007, "label": "PRODUCT", "position": {"start_offset": 145, "end_offset": 153}}, {"id": 4008, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 162, "end_offset": 195}}, {"id": 4009, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 197, "end_offset": 200}}, {"id": 4010, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 277, "end_offset": 281}}, {"id": 4011, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 320, "end_offset": 327}}, {"id": 4012, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 367, "end_offset": 370}}, {"id": 4013, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 566, "end_offset": 583}}, {"id": 4014, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 616, "end_offset": 619}}, {"id": 4015, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 631, "end_offset": 638}}, {"id": 4016, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 699, "end_offset": 708}}, {"id": 4017, "label": "FACILITY", "position": {"start_offset": 776, "end_offset": 791}}, {"id": 4018, "label": "NORP", "position": {"start_offset": 809, "end_offset": 818}}, {"id": 4019, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 843, "end_offset": 847}}, {"id": 4020, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 1030, "end_offset": 1043}}, {"id": 4021, "label": "FACILITY", "position": {"start_offset": 1075, "end_offset": 1100}}, {"id": 4022, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1113, "end_offset": 1122}}, {"id": 4023, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1164, "end_offset": 1171}}, {"id": 4024, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1279, "end_offset": 1294}}, {"id": 4025, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1316, "end_offset": 1327}}, {"id": 4026, "label": "PRODUCT", "position": {"start_offset": 1347, "end_offset": 1355}}, {"id": 4027, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1386, "end_offset": 1393}}, {"id": 4028, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1422, "end_offset": 1429}}, {"id": 4029, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 1483, "end_offset": 1511}}, {"id": 4030, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1512, "end_offset": 1531}}, {"id": 4031, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1557, "end_offset": 1564}}, {"id": 4032, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 1630, "end_offset": 1642}}, {"id": 4033, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1707, "end_offset": 1719}}, {"id": 4034, "label": "PRODUCT", "position": {"start_offset": 1733, "end_offset": 1741}}, {"id": 4035, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1142, "end_offset": 1155}}], "relations": [{"id": 1875, "head": 4035, "tail": 4023, "relation": "spouse", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1876, "head": 4006, "tail": 4005, "relation": "country for sport", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1877, "head": 4008, "tail": 4009, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1878, "head": 4006, "tail": 4010, "relation": "Org-Aff.Sports-Affiliation", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 1879, "head": 4006, "tail": 4011, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1880, "head": 4010, "tail": 4005, "relation": "country for sport", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1881, "head": 4017, "tail": 4005, "relation": "location", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1882, "head": 4030, "tail": 4029, "relation": "occupation", "relation_source": "DocRED"}]}, {"id": "article_315", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Johor Darul Ta'zim (JDT) owner Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim has pledged to help Safawi Rasid regain his former self ahead of the Super League resumption next month.

'This outlines proposals to improve the use of local goods and services and the affirmative policy for Bumiputera companies,' he said in a statement today. Tengku Zafrul said this is aimed at, among others, protecting and developing local industries as well as reducing dependency on imported goods. 2022 Budget would also focus on the recovery from the pandemic with the improvement of cash assistance programmes. The programme aims to identify the needs of the rakyat and current gaps and issues in delivering assistance, especially in light of the challenges posed by the pandemic. The PCPs would provide a review of the overall investment tax incentive framework to ensure that incentives for investors remain relevant in the current business landscape. 'The review is intended to enhance the country's overall competitiveness in attracting quality investments, which in turn would generate economic growth, support job creation and strengthen the country's fiscal position.'

The prime minister said if immediate action was not taken, Malaysia faced the risk of seeing the Malayan tiger, known by its scientific name Panthera Tigris Jacksoni, going extinct. 'More worrying is the fact that this iconic species of the country may be lost forever,' he said in a statement after chairing the first meeting of the National Tiger Conservation Task Force (MyTTF) in Putarajaya today. The Malayan tiger is a symbol of the coat of arms of Malaysia and features in the crest of states, government ministries, departments and agencies. The meeting was attended by Negri Sembilan Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Aminuddin Harun; Pahang Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Wan Rosdy Wan Ismail; Selangor Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Amirudin Shari and state executive council members representing the mentris besar of Kelantan, Terengganu, Johor, Kedah and Perak. At the federal level, Energy and Natural Resources Minister Datuk Seri Takiyuddin Hassan, Finance Minister Datuk Seri Tengku Zafrul Abdul Aziz and representatives of the relevant ministries, departments and agencies were also present. Ismail Sabri said the dwindling Malayan tiger population was due to loss of habitat and food sources resulting from land use changes, hunting and illegal trade in animals, as well as the spread of the canine distemper virus. He said today's meeting agreed with the Strategic Actions for Conservation of Harimau Malaya for a 10-year period beginning this year, through the implementation of six approaches including boots on the ground joint operations involving the Department of Wildlife and National Parks (Perhilitan), Royal Malaysia Police (PDRM), Malaysian Armed Forces (MAF) and the Orang Asli community. He said the MyTTF also agreed to preserve and strengthen habitat through sustainable land use management and to stop any activities of encroachment and illegal hunting. 'Another measure agreed to is to increase the forest cover in Peninsular Malaysia from 43.41 per cent now to 50 per cent by 2040, in line with the Fourth National Physical Plan. '(It also calls for) empowering effective governance through the establishment of the Harimau Malaya Conservation Unit under Perhilitan, Wildlife Crimes Bureau under PDRM and strengthening the National Wildlife Forensics Laboratory as a centre of excellence for ex-situ conservation of Harimau Malaya,' he added. Ismail Sabri said MyTTF also agreed to the use of innovative financial instruments to supplement the existing Ecological Fiscal Transfer for Biodiversity Conservation financial incentive and implementation of the Malayan tiger habitat accreditation scheme, apart from holding Save Harimau Malaya campaigns to boost awareness and involvement of strategic partners. He said efforts already undertaken to protect the Malayan tiger included amendments to the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010 which were passed by Parliament on December 21 last year to provide for more effective enforcement of wildlife conservation laws. Under the amendments, the maximum fine was raised from RM500,000 to RM1 million and the maximum jail term was increased from 10 years to 15 years for perpetrators of wild life crimes. 'Apart from this, there are new provisions for action to be taken against individuals who advertise the sale of wildlife online,' he said.", "entities": [{"id": 4097, "label": "PERSON", "position":

Judge Datuk Muhammad Jamil Hussin set the date after hearing submissions from lawyer Harvinderjit Singh who represented Muhammad Shafee and deputy public prosecutor Afzainizam Abdul Aziz. Earlier, Harvinderjit argued that the defence found 33 of the 51 paragraphs of Syed Nasrul Fahmi Syed Mohamad's written statement, the seventh prosecution witness, should be expunged claiming that they were unfounded and prejudicial to his client. Syed Nasrul Fahmi, was formerly IRB' s Aggressive Tax Planning Division (BPCA) Chief Assistant Director (Senior Revenue Executive I) before his service ended on February 28, 2020. Harvinderjit said the paragraphs in the written statement read out by the seventh prosecution witness were based on opinion and hearsay alone and were not relevant to Muhammad Shafee's case. 'Part of the paragraph in the written statement is irrelevant to the charges against my client and the witness gave an opinion on the interpretation of the provisions of the Income Tax Act whereas he is not entitled to give a legal opinion as he has no background in the field,' Harvinderjit said. Meanwhile, Afzainizam argued that Syed Nasrul Fahmi had been given statutory authority to conduct an investigation into the case faced by Muhammad Shafee. 'The seventh prosecution witness had made a detailed investigation into the receipt of RM9.5 million by Muhammad Shafee from former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak and the witness' written statement is based on the facts of the charge against the accused. 'The accused is taking a short cut by asking the court to expunge most of the written statement as there is no basis for him to do so,' he said, adding that the defence could challenge the testimony of the seventh prosecution witness by questioning him during the trial. According to Afzainizam, the defence's action in accusing the prosecution had charged the accused without a complete investigation was also unfounded. 'Even though a detailed investigation was made after the accused was charged, it was not prejudicial to him (the accused) or the prosecution was not prevented from obtaining relevant evidence for the purpose of proving the case against the accused,' he said. On September 13, 2018, Muhammad Shafee pleaded not guilty to two charges of receiving RM9.5 million which were proceeds from unlawful activities through two cheques issued by Najib which were deposited into his CIMB Bank Berhad account. He was also charged with two counts of engaging in transactions resulting from illegal activities, namely submitting incorrect tax returns, which is in violation of paragraph 113 (1) (a) of the Income Tax Act 1967 for the financial years ending December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014.", "entities": [{"id": 4199, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 309, "end_offset": 330}}, {"id": 4200,

Pulau Burung landfill, which was on fire last Wednesday, have been ordered to close temporarily from tomorrow until Friday.  The 10 schools are SJK (T) Ladang Byram, SJK (C) Pai Teik, SMK Seri Nibong, SJK (T) Nibong Tebal, SK Seri Sentosa, SK Keledang Jaya, SJK (T) Ladang Changkat, SMK Methodist, SK Methodist and SK Nibong Tebal.  Southern district education (PPDS) chief officer Mohamad Dziauddin Mat Saad said the decision was made after the district disaster management meeting yesterday.  He said the decision was taken as the air index in schools within a 10km radius was at AEGL 3 (Acute Exposure Guidelines Level), where the air affects the health and threatens the lives of residents.  'As a result, we have given permission to the 10 affected schools to be closed from Jan 19 to Jan 21.  'The southern district education office will inform no later than this Saturday on the status of the re-opening of the 10 schools based on the decision and advice from the Seberang Prai Selatan district disaster committee,' he said today.  Mohamad Dziauddin said during the closure of physical classes, students would resume with online lessons.  'The schools are required to inform the teachers and parents about the online classes.  'In addition, the schools are also required to inform the canteen operators, bus operators and other relevant parties for initial preparatory action.  'The schools are also required to provide staff tomorrow morning to manage students if they are present as a result of not being told about the school closure,' he added.  During the period, he stressed, school children should also wear face masks, reduce outdoor activities and to seek treatment at nearby clinics and hospitals if there are unwell.  It was reported that some 400 people from 86 families in Ladang Byram and Kampung Kebun Baru have been ordered to evacuate following air pollution brought about by the fire that gutted some 6.4ha (16 acres) of the 16ha (40 acres) landfill.  Yesterday, state Department of Environment (DoE) director Sharifah Zakiah Syed Sahab said the air quality, within a seven-kilometre radius from the landfill which was taken on Monday, was still

will send their best possible squad for the Asia Team Championships on Feb 15-20 in Shah Alam.   With the issue of world No 7 Lee Zii Jia gradually being resolved, there is hope for Malaysia to mount a strong challenge in the competition at the Setia City Convention Centre.   All-England champion Zii Jia was slapped with a two-year suspension for wanting to leave the Badminton Association of Malaysia to turn professional.  BAM have however softened their stance after the Kedahan submitted an appeal letter.   An official decision is yet to be made but it is believed that Zii Jia will be let off with just a fine.    The 23-year-old has also pledged that he will be committed to the national team for the Asian meet which also serves as a qualifier for the Thomas and Uber Cup Finals.  The top four teams from the Asian team meet will automatically qualify for the Thomas and Uber Cup Finals in Bangkok this year.   'We are in the process of finalising the team although we have until tomorrow to submit the final list of names,' said BAM secretary-general Datuk Kenny Goh.   'Whatever it is, we will definitely put our best team out there as it is the best that we can do.   'I've discussed with our two coaching directors - Wong Choong Hann and Rexy Mainaky and we will definitely be open to professional players as we want to look at the team as a whole.   'Realistically, we want to qualify on merit as well although we will also weigh what the team need tactically before deciding on whether to introduce new faces,' added Kenny.

The 10 countries are Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, India, Thailand, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Kazakhstan.

estimates that up to 20 per cent of the total of 131,281 lower primary school (Primary One to Three) pupils in the state have failed to master the three basic skills of reading, writing and counting. State Education, Information, Heritage and Culture Committee chairman Mazlan Bujang said the problem was made worse by the Covid-19 pandemic since early 2020 whenschools were forced to close as disease prevention measures. 'In this regard, the state government has designed a special programme called Didik Johor, with an allocation of RM450,000 to assist students who have dropped out of mastering the essential 3M skills. 'The programme, which will be introduced by next year, will be assisted by expert teachers through the implementation of tuition methods,' said Mazlan after launching the KPT [emailprotected] Generator Programme at the Sultan Abu Bakar Heritage Complex here today. Mazlan, who is also the Puteri Wangsa assemblyman, added that the Didik Johor pilot programme is currently being organised by the Johor Baru City Foundation in collaboration with the Iskandar Regional Development Authority (IRDA). He said it has been implemented since last month involving public housing areas in the Desa Mutiara People's Housing Project (PPR), Kempas PPR, and Bakar Batu PPR. During the recent state assembly session on November 23, Mazlan said the state had received more than 50,000 books to assist primary school pupils to read, write and count better. 'The Johor Education Department has done much to address the problem among the lower primary pupils with reading, writing and arithmetic proficiency,' he said in his reply. On the KPT [emailprotected] Generator Programme, Mazlan said that a total of 500 unemployed graduates in the state will benefit from it. Through the programme, he said Johor graduates residing in the state will obtain a Certificate in Food Service and Barista Services through training at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM). 'Graduates who take this course will be given food and beverage allowances and accommodation. They will also undergo industrial training at fast food restaurants as food management and handler trainees. 'After completing the programme, they will continue to be absorbed into work automatically upon completion of their training. 'This initiative is designed to help unemployed graduates get jobs during the Covid-19 pandemic,\" explained Mazlan.", "entities": [{"id": 4444, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 10}}, {"id": 4445, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 39}}, {"id": 4446, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 240, "end_offset": 300}}, {"id": 4447, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 301, "end_offset": 323}}, {"id": 4448, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 541, "end_offset": 552}}, {"id": 4449, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 808, "end_offset": 814}}, {"id": 4450, "label": "FACILITY", "position": {"start_offset": 883, "end_offset": 916}}, {"id": 4451, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 929, "end_offset": 935}}, {"id": 4452, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 953, "end_offset": 966}}, {"id": 4453, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 967, "end_offset": 978}}, {"id": 4454, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 995, "end_offset": 1006}}, {"id": 4455, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1059, "end_offset": 1085}}, {"id": 4456, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1112, "end_offset": 1151}}, {"id": 4457, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1153, "end_offset": 1157}}, {"id": 4458, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1247, "end_offset": 1284}}, {"id": 4459, "label": "FACILITY", "position": {"start_offset": 1286, "end_offset": 1289}}, {"id": 4460, "label": "FACILITY", "position": {"start_offset": 1292, "end_offset": 1302}}, {"id": 4461, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1308, "end_offset": 1322}}, {"id": 4462, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 1342, "end_offset": 1364}}, {"id": 4463, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1381, "end_offset": 1387}}, {"id": 4464, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1509, "end_offset": 1535}}, {"id": 4465, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1726, "end_offset": 1732}}, {"id": 4466, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1845, "end_offset": 1850}}, {"id": 4467, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1966, "end_offset": 1995}}, {"id": 4468, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1997, "end_offset": 2000}}, {"id": 4469, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 2440, "end_offset": 2446}}, {"id": 4470, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 372, "end_offset": 380}}, {"id": 4471, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 301, "end_offset": 309}}, {"id": 4472, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 310, "end_offset": 323}}, {"id": 4473, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 2419, "end_offset": 2427}}], "relations": [{"id": 1658, "head": 4472, "tail": 4471, "relation": "occupation", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1659, "head": 4447, "tail": 4446, "relation": "Org-Aff.Employment", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 1660, "head": 4447, "tail": 4446, "relation": "chairperson", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1663, "head": 4444, "tail": 4466, "relation": "capital of", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1661, "head": 4472, "tail": 4449, "relation": "given name", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1662, "head": 4450, "tail": 4444, "relation": "location", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1664, "head": 4467, "tail": 4468, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1665, "head": 4445, "tail": 4466, "relation": "location", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1669, "head": 4456, "tail": 4457, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1670, "head": 4458, "tail": 4444, "relation": "location", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1672, "head": 4461, "tail": 4444, "relation": "location", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1671, "head": 4460, "tail": 4444, "relation": "location", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1666, "head": 4455, "tail": 4456, "relation": "partnership with", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1667, "head": 4472, "tail": 4453, "relation": "occupation", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 1668, "head": 4472, "tail": 4452, "relation": "Physical.Located", "relation_source": "ACE05"}]}, {"id": "article_326", "text": "HE hasn't played a single match for Malaysia, zero experience with the national team. Thus, one can imagine coach Tan Cheng Hoe's task of grafting Johan Dion Cools into the national team within days despite his remarkable credentials.   Some football followers may even say it's a great irony   that the talented Cools, who plays for Danish club FC Midtjylland, is a 'misfit' because of the circumstances.   But it will be dumbfounding for Malaysia not to utilise the 24-year-old Cools when his playing level is at the highest in Europe - having seen action in the Champions League against the likes of Liverpool, Manchester United, Real Madrid and Ajax.   However, Cheng Hoe has sidestepped the Co ols question, refusing to even confirm he will play in Malaysia's World Cup qualifiers in Dubai next month.    But the word is already out; right-back Cools will be on a plane to Dubai from Denmark, come June 31.  Even the player's Danish club have announced that he will be playing for Malaysia.    When Timesport asked about Cools yesterday,  Cheng Hoe declined to comment on the talk that the player will join the Malaysian team for the pre-World Cup/Asian Cup campaign.   As FAM take a hush-hush stand on Cools' role, Cheng Hoe insisted that he is only focusing on the 25 players that he has in Bahrain. Malaysia were scheduled to play an international friendly against Bahrain in the city of Riffa last night.   Born to a Belgian father and Malaysian mother, Cools has an impressive record, one that is unmatched by any Harimau Malaya player.    Apart from having played against some of Europe's big guns, Cools won both the Belgium championship and Belgian Super Cup twice with Club Brugge KV.    The defender also helped FC Midtjylland capture the Danish Championship in the 2019-2020 season.  At international level, he recorded 28 youth caps for the Belgium team.   However, the Kuching-born Cools, who has never played in the M-League or joined national training before, will have only three days to fit into Harimau Malaya's style of play before the pre-World Cup match against the United Arab Emirates on June 3.    Cheng Hoe will certainly have much on his mind in deciding between  Cools, Matthew Davies and Rizal Ghazali for the right-back position.", "entities": [{"id": 4474, "label": "LOCATION", "position":

'We will look into the demands comprehensively, and I will meet with all the concession companies to understand the issues that were brought forward.

The memorandum they handed in demands that the contract system be abolished and support staff be given permanent placements, increasing wages to RM1,500 and also to stop harassment by contractors in the union.

At 6pm, the local currency was trading at 4.1815/1835 against the greenback compared with 4.1765/1795 at Friday's close. Bank Islam Bhd chief economist Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid said clearly the zero Covid-19 policy implemented by China has taken its toll when its economy growth for the final quarter of 2021 decelerates to 4.0 per cent from 4.9 per cent during the September quarter. In addition, China said its retail sales growth moderated sharply to 1.7 per cent year-on-year in December from 3.9 per cent in the prior month. ''Already, China's central bank has cut its benchmark interest rate, that is the one-year Medium Term Lending Facility by 10 basis points to 2.85 per cent. Following this, the US dollar has gained further strength,'' he said. Mohd Afzanizam said the divergence in the path of monetary policy between the US and China could also pose a great challenge to emerging market currencies in the near term. Domestically, market players are closely watching Bank Negara Malaysia's Monetary Policy Committee's (MPC) first meeting of the year for further clues on interest rate and the economy.

Penang KPDNHEP director Mohd Ridzuan Ab Ghapar said the earlier price hikes were due to factors such as the flooding in Cameron Highlands and increase in prices of fertilisers. However, he said some prices have stabilised although there were fluctuations for others. 'The prices of tomatoes have dropped by 43 per cent, broccoli too have dropped by 27.2 per cent and limes have dropped by 31.5 per cent,' he said in a press conference after checking on the prices of vegetables at the Bayan Baru Market here. He said based on observations made at the end of November, there were also 100 per cent price increases for some vegetables such as green beans. 'There are fluctuations in prices of vegetables and suppliers gave the excuse that this was due to the weather and increase in costs of fertilisers,' he said. He said the prices of vegetables in hypermarkets and supermarkets could be cheaper too compared to those in the markets as hypermarkets and supermarkets order their supplies in bulk and could get it at a lower cost price. 'The supermarkets get their supplies in bulk so it is possible for them to sell it at a lower price as their cost price is lower compared to the small traders in the markets that have limited resources and could not order their supplies in bulk like the supermarkets,' he said. He said the prices of vegetables will continue to fluctuate due to various factors but the ministry will still continue to monitor the situation. The Domestic Trade and Consumers Affairs Ministry's enforcement section has also conducted investigations under Ops Pasar to check on the entire vegetable supply chain from the importers to the wholesalers to the traders in Penang to get to the root cause for the price increase, he said. He did not dismiss the possibility that the price increase could be due to the middleman but stressed that they will need to investigate this in detail. 'We need to look at the entire supply chain to determine the cause of price increase so we will look at the suppliers, the wholesalers, the middle men and the traders,' he said. Mohd Ridzuan said their enforcement team has conducted over 100 checks on businesses premises under Ops Pasar and issued 20 Goods Information Verification Notices (NPMB) and 10 Written Notices. 'Traders who were issued notices were given between two to five days from the date they received the notice to present their explanation,' he said. Meanwhile, the KPDNHEP has also launched an Ops Menu on November 6 and will continue to conduct operations until December 31 to check on price manipulation or unreasonable pricing by restaurants and eateries. 'Our continuous checks under Ops Menu have led to the issuance of two RM500 fines out of 372 restaurants and eateries we checked,' he said. As for the recent complaint over the RM100 squids at Hameediyah Restaurant, Mohd Ridzuan said investigations into the case have concluded and been handed to the ministry in Putrajaya for further action. As for the complaint on an RM18 salted fish kailan dish at a restaurant here, he said the restaurant was issued NPMB and they are required to submit their explanations by today.", "entities": [{"id":

"KUCHING: Pakatan Harapan (PH), including DAP has never failed to bring their race-religion incitement politics from Peninsular Malaysia to Sarawak, claimed Parti Pesaka Bumiputera Bersatu (PBB) Senior Vice-President Datuk Seri Fadillah Yusof.  He said their propaganda in the 12th Sarawak election was to accuse the Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS) as undermining the multi-cultural, multi-religious harmony in the state by being in the federal government with Barisan Nasional (BN) and Pas.  He said the opposition's propaganda completely ignores the stellar track record that GPS has in maintaining racial-religious harmony in Sarawak for decades that  Sarawak is widely acknowledged to be the most harmonious and tolerant territory in Malaysia.  'How can GPS be accused of collaborating with Pas when the Islamist party is contesting against GPS in this election?  'The reason GPS decided to work with the federal government is to ensure political stability in the country and to safeguard Sarawak's rights and development - which PH and DAP had failed to do when they were in power for 22 months,' he said in a statement today.  He said PH and DAP should be reminded that they were partners with Pas in the previous Sarawak election.  Fadillah, who is also the Senior Works Minister, said the recent Timah whisky controversy was also started by DAP's partner, Parti Amanah Negara, and further instigated by a PKR parliamentarian who claimed that drinking Timah whisky was like 'drinking a Malay woman' in Parliament.  'Where was DAP's voice then? I am confident that Sarawakians have become tired and can see through the same old racial religious instigation tactics that PH and DAP bring from the peninsula in every Sarawak election,' he said.  He urged the people in Sarawak to reject DAP in the upcoming state polls.  Fadillah, who is also Petra Jaya Member of Parliament (MP) said Sarawakians would never forget how the PH government had sought to delay the development of the Pan Borneo Highway including canceling the second phase of the highway, three bridges and the denial of the budgeted RM1 billion funds to repair schools in Sarawak.  He said the PH and DAP failed to deliver their promise of 20 per cent of oil royalty to be returned to Sarawak which forced the GPS government to impose state sales tax on petroleum products.  He said GPS' involvement in the federal government had safeguarded harmony and religious tolerance in Sarawak.  Citing the recent alcohol sales ban and restriction, which will not be imposed in Sarawak, he said this shows that the GPS government's policy on religious tolerance had been consistent from the time of the state's previous chief ministers.  'GPS trusts that the people will not be influenced by the tactic of casting doubt and aspersion on the government's stance, but will continue to stand firm to protect racial and religious unity in Sarawak,' he added.", "entities": [{"id": 4631, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 7}}, {"id": 4632, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 9,

With England now out of the equation, the national men's badminton team will focus fully on Japan when the Thomas Cup Finals begin at the Ceres Arena, here, on Saturday. Badminton Association of Malaysia (BAM) president Tan Sri Mohamad Norza Zakaria, however, said they will not revise the team's quarter-final target despite England's withdrawal. Badminton England, through a brief statement on their website last night, announced their withdrawal from the prestigious tournament, citing injuries to three of their four selected singles players, making them unable to field a competitive team' in the tournament. The last-minute pullout left 2018 runners-up Japan, Malaysia and Canada in Group D. The top two teams from each group will advance to the knockout stage. Mohamad Norza, while expressing sympathy for the English team, said he wanted the young national shuttlers to continue the fine momentum of winning bronze at the recent mixed team Sudirman Cup tournament in Vantaa, Finland. 'We feel that England's withdrawal is not a big advantage for Malaysia, so we will focus fully on Japan. We have to be realistic about our target as our players have gone through a lot of matches in the Sudirman Cup. 'It may have left them a little fatigued and I do not think it's right to revise the target as we don't want to put pressure on them. 'I think our players and coaches know the kind of performances expected from them, not only by BAM, but also by the fans, so they must fight to the end,' he said when contacted. He also pointed out that the young players, who are mostly making their debut in the three team championships  Sudirman Cup, Thomas Cup and Uber Cup  have huge responsibilities on their shoulders. However, he expects that to make them better players. 'Apart from the high expectations, the young players also need to have the endurance to play in back-to-back tournaments. I am especially confident that our Thomas Cup team can go far in the tournament this time,' said Mohamad Norza. In the Sudirman Cup, which ended on Sunday, the young Malaysian shuttlers put up some commendable performances, especially en route to upsetting arch rivals Indonesia 3-2 in the quarter-finals to equal the country's previous best achievement of reaching the semi-finals in the 2009 edition in Guangzhou, China.", "entities": [{"id": 4703, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 0,

October 31, 2021, from RM101.00 million recorded previously. In an exchange filing today, the energy infrastructure and technology company said this was mainly due to lower progress from engineering, procurement, construction, installation, and commissioning (EPCIC) business activities and net unfavourable foreign exchange movement of RM16 million. Its Q3 revenue plunged 63.7 per cent YoY to RM820.00 million from RM2.26 billion posted in the same period, dragged by lower progress in EPCIC business activities. For the first nine-month period, Yinson's net profit increased 35.5 per cent to RM336.00 million from RM248.00 million, while revenue decreased 20.3 per cent to RM2.87 billion from RM3.60 billion. Yinson said global energy demand is anticipated to rise, providing a positive outlook for the energy industry as a whole. 'While alternative energy sources, such as renewables, are forecasted to have the steepest growth curve in the global energy mix, the contribution of oil and gas (O&G) is anticipated to remain significant, even in the longer term.' Yinson is cognizant of the challenges faced by the industry, including the changing appetite of financial institutions towards the industry and climate change risk.

'Based on our observation and from the sample of the tiger faeces taken, we suspect that the tigers might not be well, suffering from health problems or most probably infected by CDV as the result from the sample taken was positive.

'We believe the Gua Musang tiger case to be similar to the one in Terengganu last year.  'The virus will cause the animal to be confused and go against its predatory instincts.

Last week, a 59-year-old Orang Asli man, Anek Along, was mauled to death by a tiger at Kampung Sau near Pos Bihai, Gua Musang.", "entities": [{"id": 4765, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 9}}, {"id": 4766, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 108, "end_offset": 117}}, {"id": 4767, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 119, "end_offset": 129}}, {"id": 4768, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 200, "end_offset": 229}}, {"id": 4769, "label": "FACILITY", "position": {"start_offset": 319, "end_offset": 350}}, {"id": 4770, "label": "FACILITY", "position": {"start_offset": 352, "end_offset": 356}}, {"id": 4771, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 361, "end_offset": 366}}, {"id": 4772, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 669, "end_offset": 678}}, {"id": 4773, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 691, "end_offset": 696}}, {"id": 4774, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 868, "end_offset": 878}}, {"id": 4775, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 918, "end_offset": 928}}, {"id": 4776, "label": "NORP", "position": {"start_offset": 1246, "end_offset": 1256}}, {"id": 4777, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1264, "end_offset": 1274}}, {"id": 4778, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1333, "end_offset": 1342}}, {"id": 4779, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1347, "end_offset": 1356}}, {"id": 4780, "label": "NORP", "position": {"start_offset": 1406, "end_offset": 1416}}, {"id": 4781, "label": "NORP", "position": {"start_offset": 1542, "end_offset": 1552}}, {"id": 4782, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1558, "end_offset": 1568}}, {"id": 4783, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1604, "end_offset": 1615}}, {"id": 4784, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1621, "end_offset": 1630}}, {"id": 4785, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1632, "end_offset": 1642}}, {"id": 4786, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 200, "end_offset": 208}}, {"id": 4787, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 209, "end_offset": 229}}, {"id": 4788, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 59}}], "relations": [{"id": 2273, "head": 4784, "tail": 4785, "relation": "Part-Whole.Geo", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 2275, "head": 4783, "tail": 4785, "relation": "Part-Whole.Geo", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 2281, "head": 4787, "tail": 4788, "relation": "member of", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2284, "head": 4787, "tail": 4773, "relation": "given name", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2285, "head": 4782, "tail": 4781, "relation": "ethnic group", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2286, "head": 4782, "tail": 4783, "relation": "Physical.Located", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 2274, "head": 4783, "tail": 4784, "relation": "Physical.Near", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 2276, "head": 4769, "tail": 4770, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2277, "head": 4766, "tail": 4767, "relation": "Part-Whole.Geo", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 2278, "head": 4787, "tail": 4786, "relation": "occupation", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2279, "head": 4787, "tail": 4788, "relation": "Org-Aff.Membership", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 2280, "head": 4787, "tail": 4788, "relation": "director / manager", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2282, "head": 4769, "tail": 4771, "relation": "location", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2283, "head": 4769, "tail": 4771, "relation": "Gen-Aff.Loc-Origin", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 3768, "head": 4766, "tail": 4767, "relation": "location", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 3769, "head": 4772, "tail": 4774, "relation": "location", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 3770, "head": 4776, "tail": 4777, "relation": "Physical.Located", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 3771, "head": 4778, "tail": 4777, "relation": "Part-Whole.Geo", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 3772, "head": 4779, "tail": 4777, "relation": "Part-Whole.Geo", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 3773, "head": 4772, "tail": 4774, "relation": "Part-Whole.Geo", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 3774, "head": 4778, "tail": 4777, "relation": "location", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 3775, "head": 4779, "tail": 4777, "relation": "location", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 3776, "head": 4783, "tail": 4784, "relation": "location", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 3777, "head": 4784, "tail": 4785, "relation": "location", "relation_source": "DocRED"}]}, {"id": "article_336", "text": "TERENGGANU Cycling Team (TSG) are hoping for better luck at the National Road  Championship which kicks off in Melaka today.

"article_337", "text": "KOTA KINABALU, Jan 18  Sabah aims to earn up to RM5.6 billion annually by leveraging on its forests in carbon credit and other nature monetising deals, said deputy chief minister Datuk Seri Jeffrey Kitingan. The state agriculture and fisheries minister said the state has taken steps to modernise the industry and create a new source of income by monetising Sabah's many natural assets. 'This funding with nature conservation and carbon trading will unlock the conservation assets. We expect to raise RM2.2 billion to RM5.6 billion annually without cutting a single tree, and at the same time, preserve and safeguard the interests of indigenous communities,' he said. 'The success of the Nature Conservation Agreement is expected to attract private funding of up to US$10 billion (RM41.8 billion).' Kitingan said this during his speech at the Sabah International Business and Economic Summit here today. 'At the same time, we will be deploying innovative technologies such as satellite services, usage of drones and AI Artificial Intelligence. With these, Sabah will be moving into a green and circular economy, while complying with the United Nation's 17 sustainable development goals. With this nature conservation funding, the state aims to strengthen deliveries and implementation of its Sabah Maju Jaya programmes whose aim is to accelerate economic growth and eradicate rural poverty through three main thrusts: agriculture, industry and tourism. Sabah recently came under scrutiny from conservation groups for a controversial carbon credit deal that could see up to two million hectares, or more than half of Sabah's forests, being put up for a pilot project. The deal, named the Nature Conservation Agreement or NCA, drew flak for its lack of transparency, and for also involving a little-known Singapore-based firm that was to receive 30 per cent of profits. Since then, civil and conservation groups have protested the agreement, while Sabah Chief Minister Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor reassured them that the government will take all the necessary precautions to ensure state interests come first.", "entities": [{"id": 4832, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 13}}, {"id": 4833, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 28}}, {"id": 4834, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 157, "end_offset": 178}}, {"id": 4835, "label": "TITLE", "position": {"start_offset": 179, "end_offset": 189}}, {"id": 4836, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 190, "end_offset": 206}}, {"id": 4837, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 244, "end_offset": 252}}, {"id": 4838, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 358, "end_offset": 363}}, {"id": 4839, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 799, "end_offset": 807}}, {"id": 4840, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1056, "end_offset": 1061}}, {"id": 4841, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1137, "end_offset": 1150}}, {"id": 4842, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 1292, "end_offset": 1307}}, {"id": 4843, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1453, "end_offset": 1458}}, {"id": 4844, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1616, "end_offset": 1621}}, {"id": 4845, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1946, "end_offset": 1951}}, {"id": 4846, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 1952, "end_offset": 1966}}, {"id": 4847, "label": "TITLE", "position": {"start_offset": 1967, "end_offset": 1977}}, {"id": 4848, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 212, "end_offset": 243}}, {"id": 4849, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 179, "end_offset": 206}}, {"id": 4850, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 157, "end_offset": 206}}, {"id": 4851, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1978, "end_offset": 1989}}, {"id": 4852, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1803, "end_offset": 1812}}, {"id": 4853, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1967, "end_offset": 1989}}, {"id": 4854, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1952, "end_offset": 1989}}, {"id": 4855, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1946, "end_offset": 1989}}, {"id": 4856, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 843, "end_offset": 891}}], "relations": [{"id": 2340, "head": 4851, "tail": 4847, "relation": "award received", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2341, "head": 4851, "tail": 4846, "relation": "occupation", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2342, "head": 4851, "tail": 4845, "relation": "Physical.Located", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 2343, "head": 4836, "tail": 4835, "relation": "award received", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2344, "head": 4836, "tail": 4834, "relation": "occupation", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2345, "head": 4836, "tail": 4837, "relation": "occupation", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2346, "head": 4836, "tail": 4848, "relation": "member of", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2347, "head": 4836, "tail": 4848, "relation": "Org-Aff.Membership", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 2348, "head": 4836, "tail": 4839, "relation": "given name", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2349, "head": 4836, "tail": 4856, "relation": "participant", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 3778, "head": 4832, "tail": 4833, "relation": "Part-Whole.Geo", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 3779, "head": 4832, "tail": 4833, "relation": "location", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 3780, "head": 4839, "tail": 4856, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 3781, "head": 4840, "tail": 4841, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}]}, {"id": "article_338", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: How low can Malaysia go?

Laos captain Bounphachan Bounkong broke past the Malaysia defence to deliver a clinical finish.    Yet, Laos were not content with the equaliser. They pressed on, and in the  79th minute, were rewarded with the winning goal. Defender Phoutthavong took a shot and it went in.

(YTL Corp) expanded its net loss to RM368.69 million in the financial year ended June 30, 2021 (FY2021), compared with a net loss of RM189.22 million in the same period last year. Revenue also eased to RM17.36 billion versus RM19.18 billion recorded previously. In a filing with Bursa Malaysia today, the conglomerate said the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted various operating business segments, especially in its construction business, whereby the decrease in revenue was due to the lower progress of construction works. For its cement and building materials industry, the group said revenue decreased marginally due to lower demand in the concrete business. Meanwhile, for the property investment and development, the group said the decrease in revenue was mainly due to the deconsolidation of the results of YLT Corp-controlled Starhill Global Real Investment Trust. 'Lower sales were also recorded in The Fennel project undertaken by its subsidiary Sentul Raya Sdn Bhd and the 3-Orchard By-The-Park project undertaken by YTL Westwood,' said the group. On prospect, YTL Corp said the group's businesses have been cushioned by its utilities segment. 'Essential services continued to operate throughout the movement control order period as well as the construction and cement segments which re-commenced in stages as permitted where operations have normalised. 'Furthermore, the ongoing progress in vaccine development and recent commencement of vaccination programmes in most countries where the group operates, including the rollout of Malaysia's vaccination programme, are vital developments, providing the pathway for a return to normalcy and economic recovery,' it said. For the cement and building materials industry, the group maintains its view that the solid dynamics of its main markets remain intact. 'Key growth drivers, such as infrastructure requirements and demand for housing from urbanisation, will continue to underpin demand growth in the longer term. 'Despite the challenging outlook, the group expects the performance of its business segments to remain resilient as these segments' operations are substantially essential in nature,' said YTL Corp. The group will continue to closely monitor the related risks and impact on all business segments, it said, adding that the group has also declared an interim dividend of 2.5 sen per ordinary share for the financial year ended June 30, 2021. The interim dividend will be paid on October 12, 2021, said the group.", "entities": [{"id": 4897, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 12}}, {"id": 4898, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 41}}, {"id": 4899, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 43, "end_offset": 51}}, {"id": 4900, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 321, "end_offset": 335}}, {"id": 4901, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 852, "end_offset": 860}}, {"id": 4902, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 872, "end_offset": 909}}, {"id": 4903, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 994, "end_offset": 1013}}, {"id": 4904, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1066, "end_offset": 1078}}, {"id": 4905, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1110, "end_offset": 1118}}, {"id": 4906, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1580, "end_offset": 1588}}, {"id": 4907, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 2201, "end_offset": 2210}}, {"id": 4908, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 378, "end_offset": 386}}], "relations": [{"id": 2404, "head": 4898, "tail": 4905, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2405, "head": 4898, "tail": 4903, "relation": "subsidiary", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2410, "head": 4898, "tail": 4907, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2402, "head": 4898, "tail": 4899, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2403, "head": 4898, "tail": 4901, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2406, "head": 4898, "tail": 4903, "relation": "Part-Whole.Subsidary", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 2407, "head": 4901, "tail": 4902, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2408, "head": 4898, "tail": 4904, "relation": "subsidiary", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2409, "head": 4898, "tail": 4904, "relation": "Part-Whole.Subsidary", "relation_source": "ACE05"}]}, {"id": "article_340", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 14  An aide to Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin said the former prime minister had performed 'umrah' without neither a complete Covid-19 nor meningococcal meningitis (MM) vaccines in March 2021 as they were not mandatory then. In a statement, Mohd Naim Mahmod today said all the delegates then including the former prime minister had received their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine before leaving for Saudi Arabia and received their second one upon returning home. They were not vaccinated against MM as it was not made mandatory by both the Malaysian and Saudi governments as well. 'At that time, the Malaysian and Saudi Arabian governments did not impose complete conditions on the injection of Covid-19 vaccine or other vaccines for any traveller wishing to travel to Saudi Arabia,' he said. He also said Muhyiddin's official working visit was subject to strict standard operating procedures including PCR testing before, during and after the visit. Those PCR tests found that all delegates were negative for Covid-19, he said. Mohd Naim said thus, the claim made by independent preacher Abu Syafiq yesterday that Muhyiddin had not taken any vaccine for the Muslim minor pilgrimage is false. Abu Syafiq courted controversy after claiming that he had taken several umrah pilgrims without vaccination in his Instagram account, accusing several ministers of doing the same. The religious affairs minister Idris Ahmad has since urged the relevant authorities to investigate the freelance preacher. The government had decided to temporarily suspend travel permission to perform umrah starting January 8 to curb the spread of the Omicron Covid-19 variant which led to allegations of discrimination against Muslims hurled by critics. Earlier this week, the Health Ministry said a total of 16 Covid-19 clusters involving umrah pilgrims returning from Saudi Arabia have been detected from November 25, 2021 until today, with seven of the clusters' index cases confirmed to be of the Omicron variant.", "entities": [{"id": 4909, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 12}}, {"id": 4910, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 57}}, {"id": 4911, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 253, "end_offset": 269}}, {"id": 4912, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 409, "end_offset": 421}}, {"id": 4913, "label": "NORP", "position": {"start_offset": 550, "end_offset": 559}}, {"id": 4914, "label": "NORP", "position": {"start_offset": 564, "end_offset": 569}}, {"id": 4915, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 779, "end_offset": 791}}, {"id": 4916, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 816, "end_offset": 825}}, {"id": 4917, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1039, "end_offset": 1048}}, {"id": 4918, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 1078, "end_offset": 1098}}, {"id": 4919, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1099, "end_offset": 1109}}, {"id": 4920, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1125, "end_offset": 1134}}, {"id": 4921, "label": "NORP", "position": {"start_offset": 1169, "end_offset": 1175}}, {"id": 4922, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1203, "end_offset": 1213}}, {"id": 4923, "label": "PRODUCT", "position": {"start_offset": 1317, "end_offset": 1326}}, {"id": 4924, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 1353, "end_offset": 1362}}, {"id": 4925, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 1386, "end_offset": 1412}}, {"id": 4926, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1413, "end_offset": 1424}}, {"id": 4927, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 1485, "end_offset": 1503}}, {"id": 4928, "label": "NORP", "position": {"start_offset": 1711, "end_offset": 1718}}, {"id": 4929, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1761, "end_offset": 1776}}, {"id": 4930, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1854, "end_offset": 1866}}, {"id": 4931, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 610, "end_offset": 619}}, {"id": 4932, "label": "TITLE", "position": {"start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 40}}, {"id": 4933, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 41, "end_offset": 57}}, {"id": 4934, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 67, "end_offset": 88}}, {"id": 4935, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1078, "end_offset": 1109}}, {"id": 4936, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1386, "end_offset": 1424}}, {"id": 4937, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 318, "end_offset": 339}}, {"id": 4938, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 624, "end_offset": 649}}], "relations": [{"id": 2412, "head": 4933, "tail": 4934, "relation": "occupation", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2413, "head": 4933, "tail": 4912, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2414, "head": 4933, "tail": 4916, "relation": "given name", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2417, "head": 4919, "tail": 4918, "relation": "occupation", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2418, "head": 4919, "tail": 4922, "relation": "given name", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2411, "head": 4933, "tail": 4932, "relation": "award received", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2415, "head": 4933, "tail": 4920, "relation": "given name", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2416, "head": 4911, "tail": 4917, "relation": "given name", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2419, "head": 4926, "tail": 4925, "relation": "occupation", "relation_source": "DocRED"}]}, {"id": "article_341", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 6  Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) chief commissioner Tan Sri Azam Baki has demanded a public apology and RM10 million from the whistleblower in his stock trading scandal for alleged defamation.

(Part 1)' and 'Business ties among MACC leadership: How deep does it go (Part 2)'. Azam gave Lalitha 14 days to comply, failing which he would initiate defamation proceedings against her. Lalitha earlier shared a copy of the legal notice by the MACC chief's lawyers in a tweet, to which she said, 'thanks'. Former MACC advisory board member Edmund Terence Gomez called Azam's letter of demand an act of intimidation, telling him to withdraw the notice immediately as Lalitha had raised a legitimate question of national interest. 'What Azam should be doing is to publicly disclose all his business interests in order to protect the image and integrity of the MACC. 'If whistleblowers were threatened by those in a position of power, how can we make any progress to get citizens to expose corruption, and protect them for doing so?' he said. Yesterday, Azam said in a press conference he had willingly given his brother permission to buy shares using his share trading account and had already given an explanation to the Anti-Corruption Advisory Board (LPPR).

LUMPUR, Jan 9  Penang state officials are slated to convene a meeting in an effort to save Sekolah Kebangsaan Assumption in Butterworth which is set to be permanently closed on February 28 after some 89 years. Bagan Dalam assemblyman Satees Muniandy said the Penang government would hold a meeting with the Education Department officials, school administrators, and the parent-teacher association, news portal Free Malaysia Today reported today. Sarees said the meeting would be chaired by Penang Deputy Chief Minister II P. Ramasamy who is also the state executive councillor for education. SK Assumption was reported to have been founded in 1933 by the La Salle Brothers, an order of the Catholic church. The church relinquished all rights when the school was relocated in 2008. News of SK Assumption's closure came as schools nationwide reopened classrooms recently for the delayed third-term of the 2021 school year. Its alumni and the parent-teacher association had formed a joint task force called Save Assumption School joint task force. Group spokesman Vernon Christopher Fernandez said they were informed of the closure on January 8 by deputy state education director Abdul Said Hussain as the land on which the school sits is being claimed by its owner, Sri Avenue Sdn Bhd. According to Free Malaysia Today, Sri Avenue agreed to set up SK Assumption on its land in 2008 on the understanding that the Education Ministry would buy over the development. However, the news portal reported that the ministry had since rejected the offer to buy. Fernandez said Abdul Said had stated that the school's education licence would be revoked upon the school's closure. 'As of the moment, the joint task force is not able to get hold of any representative of the landowner to verify Abdul Said's claim,' Fernandez told Free Malaysia Today. The school, currently located at Kampung Ujung Batu near the Perai river, has faced problems for the past 26 years after the original site of the school in Jalan Assumption was sold to property developers in 1995. Students used classrooms at Sekolah Kebangsaan Jalan Sungai Nyiur for 13 years until the current building was constructed on the present site in 2008.", "entities": [{"id": 5002, "label": "LOCATION",

of Biotechnology Malaysia (NIBM) to expand research and development (R&D) capabilities to produce locally made vaccines. Today, both entities have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU). The collaboration was proposed to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob at the launching ceremony of the National Vaccine Development Roadmap and Malaysian Genome and Vaccine Institute. The MoU was signed by Pharmaniaga group managing director Datuk Zulkarnain Md Eusope and NIBM acting chief executive officer and Agro-Biotechnology Institute Malaysia director Dr Seetha Jaganathan King.  Zulkarnain said the R&D cooperation between both parties would spur further pertinent efforts in the pharmaceutical industry to help the government protect the national interest by having locally developed and produced vaccines to fulfil the rakyat's needs. 'Malaysia has been relying on the importation of vaccines as currently no human vaccines are being developed and produced locally.  'The closest is the fill and finish manufacturing of Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine by our wholly-owned subsidiary Pharmaniaga LifeScience Sdn Bhd (PLS),' he said. Zulkarnain said Pharmaniaga would cooperate with NIBM in many areas of R&D and training on vaccines, allowing Malaysia to develop and produce various types of vaccines for babies, children and adults in the near future. 'We are confident with the outcome of this cooperation as PLS has more than 300 professional, scientific workforce, and it has developed more than 240 generic drugs which we later manufacture on our own for the local and international markets. 'Indeed, this cooperation will also be another step towards building national readiness against any pandemic in the future, as well strengthen Pharmaniaga's plan to establish world's first halal vaccine manufacturing plant in Malaysia,' he said. Pharmaniaga is the product registration holder and sole distributor of the Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine in Malaysia. To date, Pharmaniaga has supplied 20.4 million doses of the vaccine to the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.  At its high-tech EU certified plant, PLS can manufacture four million doses of fill and finish Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine a month and currently supplies the vaccine needs of the private market.",

been urged to support Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS) to allow the continuity of the newly launched Post Covid-19 Development Strategy (PCDS) 2030 without any interruptions.  GPS chairman and caretaker chief minister Tan Sri Abang Johari Openg said the people of Sarawak need to play their part to ensure the continuity of the development strategy, and not allow it to be affected by any change in leadership.  'I hope the people will play their role for the future of Sarawak and their grandchildren,' he told a press conference after the Gedong state seat nomination process this morning.  Abang Johari will face Mohamad Sofian Fariz Sharbini from Parti Sarawak Bersatu (PSB), Kamal Bujang from Parti Amanah Negara (Amanah) and Tomson Ango from Parti Bumi Kenyalang (PBK) in the Sarawak state election.  This is the first time Abang Johari will be contesting in the Gedong state seat, after moving from the Satok state seat which he won for eight consecutive terms.  He was given the go-ahead by Datuk Naroden Majais, who had offered to make way for Abang Johari to stand in the rural seat. During the 11th Sarawak State Election in 2016, Naroden won the seat with a majority of 3,365 votes defeating Amanah candidate Rapelson Richard and Independent broker Uja Bansi.  Meanwhile, Abang Johari said he is confident voters will evaluate what has been implemented by the GPS-led government, and how the party had managed the state to date.  He said a new manifesto which is a continuation from the 2016 manifesto, will be announced on Wednesday.  'Although some people say the manifesto is not a bible, but for us it is an agreement that we should implement as best we can.  'So far, we have delivered what we had promised in 2016.'  On the nomination process, Abang Johari said he was made to understand that the process ran smoothly.  'This is proof that the democratic process in the state is alive.  'I would like to thank those involved in the nomination process, including the security forces and the Election Commission (EC).  'Also, the general public for adhering to the standard operating procedures (SOP) today.  'The campaigning period will begin after this and I hope all the candidates will follow the instructions from the EC and also the authorities with regard to the SOP,' he said.", "entities": [{"id":

The central bank'sMonetary Policy Committee will conveneto decide on the OPR today, which would provide clues onthe current economic situation and the recovery outlook for Malaysia, an analyst said. Earlier on, OCBC Bank said that the slashing of Malaysia's 2021 gross domestic product (GDP) growth outlook mightbe a prelude to a potential cut in the OPR. Last month, BNM GovernorDatuk Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus saidMalaysia's projected economic growth for 2021 has beenrevised to be between three and four per cent, lower than the earlier projection of between six and seven per cent. She attributed the lower growth projectionto the re-imposition of the nationwide Covid-19 containment measures following the spike in the local infection rate. Meanwhile, the US dollar'ssafe-havenstaturehelped the greenbackto hold on to its gains despite emerging signs that the United States (US)economic growth is being hampered by a resurgence in coronavirus cases, as well as other challenges. The US Federal Reserve's latest survey of the nation's business conditions showed that the country's economic activitieshad 'downshifted' in July and August, following rising concerns over Covid-19 cases, supply chain problems and labor shortages.

BE's shock move is seen by many as making a mockery of the Thomas Cup, for long, the most prestigious international men's team competition,   And this is not the first time. In  2018, England pulled out from the Thomas Cup in Bangkok, leading to Hong Kong coming in as a replacement.   But this time, there will be no substitute. Group D will have just three teams, Malaysia, Japan and Canada.    BE, the national body for English badminton, cited injuries to three singles players for their decision to give the Thomas Cup finals a miss.   However, English fans are not convinced, with many voicing their annoyance in social media.   'Give the chance to the next best players. They're all in universities, so they'd be available to play,' said a Twitter user.    'Not offering the opportunity to the next best players isn't inspiring, and isn't fair to the doubles players,' said another Twitter user.    A fan commented: 'Biggest men's tournament in the events calendar and we haven't even got enough decent players to send a team! Embarrassing.'    The four English singles shuttlers,  who were initially selected for the Thomas Cup were world No 51 Toby Penty, Johnnie Torjussen (No 198), Harry Huang (No 319) and Ethan Rose (No 436).    England national champion Torjussen was the only player who featured in all three group ties at the recent Sudirman Cup in Finland.    BE have come under heavy criticism over the last few months, especially after they dropped world No 12 men's doubles, Marcus Ellis-Chris Langridge from the Tokyo Olympics in July.    A fortnight ago, BE long-serving chief executive, Adrian Christy, stepped down after helming the organisation for 15 years, raising more questions on the stability of the national body.   It remains to be seen if England, the founding country of the Thomas Cup, will face sanctions from the Badminton World Federation for their last-minute withdrawal.    England's 'lack of respect' for the Thomas Cup does not go well with sporting spirit, and their action also deprives other teams of a chance to compete in the hallowed competition.", "entities":

situation in Dengkil, which was hit by floods for about a week since last Saturday, seems to be improving, especially with the fine weather today. Residents are busy cleaning their houses and compound, as well as putting out their furniture and carpets to dry, while some food stall and grocery stores have opened for business. A survey by Bernama found that water, which was about knee-high, at Taman Permata, Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan Tamil (SJKT) and Kampung Sri Tanjung, had receded completely. A team of firefighters from the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) Fire and Rescue Station was at SJKT Dengkil helping volunteers to clean the school. KLIA Zone Fire Assistant Superintendent Norhaizat Ramli, when met at the school, said a total of three fire teams from KLIA were mobilized to help flood victims with the cleaning-up in the Sepang area today. The area covers SJKT Dengkil, Kampung Jenderam and Bukit Changgang with a team of 10 firemen at each location. He said the post-flood assistance could only be conducted today as the team was previously involved in sanitation work at several flood relief centres (PPS). 'In SJKT Dengkil, almost 70 per cent of the damaged equipment, such as chairs and tables, have been removed the help of volunteers. We are here to supply water to wash away the thick mud,' he added. Senior Education Minister Datuk Dr Radzi Jidin yesterday announced that the third term school session 2021/2022 will be postponed for a week following the flood disaster. He said schools in Group A states namely Johor, Kedah, Kelantan and Terengganu would open on January 9 and January10 for schools in Group B states namely Melaka, Negri Sembilan, Pahang, Perak, Perlis Penang, Sabah, Sarawak, Selangor, Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya and the Federal Territory of Labuan.

clear, Ukrainian ambassador Olexander Nechytaylo said today in an interview with local radio station BFM. The European diplomat said his office took note of Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob's statement on the situation, adding that there is room for Malaysia to make its position clearer. 'We took note of the statement of the prime minister yesterday. We believe there is room for a clearer position on international law and on the sanctity of the United Nations charter. 'So far, we have to be very clear who is the invader and the criminal,' Nechytaylo said in response to questions on statements issued by several South-east Asian governments in the wake of Russia's full-scale military strikes against several Ukrainian cities yesterday. Nechytaylo commended Singapore and Indonesia for issuing strong statements. But Nechytaylo also said he had received emails and text messages from many Malaysians expressing their support for Ukraine. 'In the past days and weeks, I have been overwhelmed with so many emails and messages from the general public, business people and some are from royal families here in Malaysia. 'We thank you so much for your support and solidarity. 'Malaysia is a true friend of Ukraine and we really appreciate it,' he added. PM Ismail Sabri issued a statement on Twitter yesterday, expressing his regret over the situation in Ukraine and his hope for a peaceful settlement between Ukraine and Russia. Ismail Sabri also said his government's priority is to ensure that Malaysians in Ukraine are safe. Russia's military strikes have been condemned by many countries in the west. Several have also imposed sanctions against Russia. Closer to home, the Singapore and Indonesia governments have issued statements condemning Russia's invasion and demanded the one-time world superpower cease its military actions against Ukraine and take the conflict to the table instead in accordance with the United Nations Charter and international law. Russia launched attacks on the eastern Ukrainian region of Donbas yesterday. In announcing the military strikes, Russian president Vladmir Putin said the operation was to protect people from a purported genocide by the Kyiv government in eastern Ukraine.", "entities": [{"id":

Also present were Malaysian Makkal Sakti Party president, Datuk Seri RS Thanenthiran and Johor State Makkal Sakti chairman, Datuk Seri DR Suriya. Meanwhile, Ahmad, who is also the Pontian Member of Parliament said Umno and BN appreciated the undivided support from Makkal Sakti which remained loyal to the party and coalition during good and bad times. 'We were moved when Makkal Sakti pledged to mobilise the (party) machinery to help Umno and BN campaigns in the Johor election. 'Makkal Sakti has 27,000 members with 16 divisions in Johor and this is an asset to BN especially in campaigning for the Indian (votes) in the state,' he said. Meanwhile, Ahmad said the two Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu) who departed from the Perikatan Nasional component party have not applied to join Umno. 'Not yet, they (two-state assemblymen) have not submitted applications to join Umno,' he said. Yesterday, Larkin assemblyman Datuk Mohd Izhar, who is also the Johor Investment, Entrepreneur Development, Cooperatives and Human Resources Committee chairman, announced his departure from Bersatu with immediate effect. Last Thursday, Tebrau Bersatu division chief, Mazlan Bujang resigned as division chief and announced his withdrawal from the party also with immediate effect. However, Mazlan, who is also the Puteri Wangsa state assemblyman and former Bersatu Johor chairman has not joined any party so far but has since backed the BN government. Ahmad thanked the two-state assemblymen who expressed their support for BN and the Mentri Besar, Datuk Hasni Mohammad. 'I would like to state that no reward was offered or promised to the two-state assemblymen. 'They made the decision voluntarily, in good faith and without being promised anything because they are confident in the BN-led government. 'Thank you for their support and confidence, it means a lot to Umno and BN,' he said.", "entities": [{"id": 5304, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 10}}, {"id": 5305,

"KUALA LUMPUR: Johor Darul Ta'zim (JDT) went down 1-0 to Japan's Nagoya Grampus in their Asian Champions League (ACL) Group G opener at the Rajamangala Stadium in Bangkok yesterday.    Midfielder Hiroyuki Abe's controversial goal in the 60th minute handed the Japanese side full points.   The match was a closely contested affair in the first half with both sides finding it hard to break through. And it turned scrappy, leading to both sides picking up two yellow cards each.    JDT's teen winger Arif Aiman Hanapi was the bright spark for the Malaysian side on the left flank, and he came close to scoring in the 42nd minute. But his attempt was saved by the Grampus keeper.    The second half saw both teams stringing together more fluid moves, having settled down. And JDT striker Bergson looked dangerous with his attempts. However, the Brazilian's two attempts were not on target.   Off a counter-attack, Nagoya got the only goal of the evening.    It happened when the Southern Tigers seemed to switch off inside their box, and expected an offside call from the referee. But it never came, and Abe fired home from close range after receiving a pass from Ryogo Yamasaki in the 60th minute.   After seizing the lead, Nagoya tightened their defence, and relied on  counter-attacks. And the Japanese side  could have added at least two more goals if they had been more clinical in their finishing.   JDT seemed to have got the equaliser in the 92nd minute from Bergson's header, but referee Mohammed Abdulla Hassan disallowed the goal as  Bergson was adjudged to have fouled Nagoya defender Shinnosuke Nakatani.   JDT's next group match is against Thailand's Ratchaburi at the Rajamangala Stadium on Friday.", "entities": [{"id": 5390, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 12}},

leave the national team. Yesterday, the 24-year-old told reporters at the Academy Badminton Malaysia (ABM) in Bukit Kiara that the announcement, if there is one, will be from the BA of Malaysia (BAM). World No 7 Zii Jia, who reported for training, as usual, said: 'It is not my place to comment on this matter. If there is an announcement, it will come from BAM. 'As a player, I want to play and perform, to produce results and make my country proud. 'If I were a rebel, you wouldn't see me in this training centre today (yesterday),' said Zii Jia. On Monday, BAM called for an emergency council meeting. While there has been no confirmation from the national body, it is learnt that the council had convened to discuss the future of the reigning All England champion, who seemed to have made up his mind to turn independent. As an institution that has invested a lot of money into developing players from their junior years, BAM can ban a shuttler from competing as a professional if they decide to quit the national team prematurely. This was the case with former players like Tan Chun Seang and Toh Ee Wei, though the latter rejoined the national team soon after being pardoned. When probed further on whether he had tendered his resignation or if he was still a BAM player, Zii Jia took a long pause before replying: 'As I had mentioned earlier, if I were a rebel, I would not be training here with my teammates today.' The Kedah-born also went on to say that he should not be compared to former world No 1 Lee Chong Wei, who until the end of his illustrious 20-year career remained loyal to BAM. 'Firstly, I am not Chong Wei. What he has achieved is totally different from me.' Meanwhile, on his targets for the year, Zii Jia said he will try to break into the world's top five and achieve podium finishes in major events, including the Thomas Cup, Asian Games, Commonwealth Games and the World Championships.", "entities": [{"id": 5434, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}}, {"id": 5435, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 153, "end_offset": 179}}, {"id": 5436, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 181, "end_offset": 184}}, {"id": 5437, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 189, "end_offset": 200}}, {"id": 5438, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 258, "end_offset": 272}}, {"id": 5439, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 274, "end_offset": 277}}, {"id": 5440, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 291, "end_offset": 298}}, {"id": 5441, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 437, "end_offset": 440}}, {"id": 5442, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 619, "end_offset": 626}}, {"id": 5443, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 639, "end_offset": 642}}, {"id": 5444, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1005, "end_offset": 1008}}, {"id": 5445, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1158, "end_offset": 1172}}, {"id": 5446, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1177, "end_offset": 1187}}, {"id": 5447, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1345, "end_offset": 1348}}, {"id": 5448, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1357, "end_offset": 1364}}, {"id": 5449, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1507, "end_offset": 1512}}, {"id": 5450, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1590, "end_offset": 1603}}, {"id": 5451, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1675, "end_offset": 1678}}, {"id": 5452, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1699, "end_offset": 1708}}, {"id": 5453, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1802, "end_offset": 1809}}, {"id": 5454, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 1921, "end_offset": 1931}}, {"id": 5455, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 1933, "end_offset": 1944}}, {"id": 5456, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 1946, "end_offset": 1964}}, {"id": 5457, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 1973, "end_offset": 1992}}, {"id": 5458, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 826, "end_offset": 846}}, {"id": 5459, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 20}}], "relations": [{"id": 2535, "head": 5459, "tail": 5434, "relation": "occupation", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2536, "head": 5435, "tail": 5436, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2537, "head": 5435, "tail": 5437, "relation": "Gen-Aff.Loc-Origin", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 2538, "head": 5436, "tail": 5437, "relation": "Gen-Aff.Loc-Origin", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 2539, "head": 5435, "tail": 5437, "relation": "location", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2540, "head": 5436, "tail": 5437, "relation": "location", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2541, "head": 5459, "tail": 5440, "relation": "given name", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2542, "head": 5438, "tail": 5439, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2543, "head": 5450, "tail": 5452, "relation": "given name", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2544, "head": 5448, "tail": 5449, "relation": "Gen-Aff.CRRE", "relation_source": "ACE05"}]}, {"id": "article_353", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: The Malaysian Aviation Commission (Mavcom) has approved 27 out of 28 air traffic rights (ATRs) applications submitted by airlines for the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2021. In a statement today, the commission said this represented an increase of 33.3 per cent in applications and a 28.6 per cent increase in approvals compared to the third quarter (Q3) of 2021. Of the 28 ATR applications, 17 were for domestic routes, which have more than doubled compared to the seven applications submitted in Q3 of 2021. Malaysia Airlines Bhd and World Cargo Airline Sdn Bhd received the highest number of approvals with six ATRs each, while AirAsia Group Bhd received an allocation of five ATRs and M Jets International Sdn Bhd was awarded three ATR allocations. Additionally, AirAsia X Bhd, FlyFirefly Sdn Bhd and Malindo Airways Sdn Bhd received two ATR allocations each, whereas MyJet Express Airlines Sdn Bhd was awarded one ATR allocation. Mavcom said the increase was primarily due to the reopening of interstate borders in October 2021 and a rise in demand for domestic holiday-related travel, with the additional flights mainly to Langkawi followed by Johor Bahru, Penang, and Kota Bharu.  Executive chairman Datuk Seri Saripuddin Kasim said Mavcom is seeing encouraging signs of recovery within the domestic segment, despite the ongoing pandemic. 'This promising development illustrates the sector's resilience and its ability to bounce back post-pandemic. 'We hope this continues as air travellers are highly encouraged to pre-plan their flights for festive periods well in advance to avoid crowds and high-ticket prices,' he said. Mavcom also received 13 ATR applications from the air cargo segment, signalling continued and sustained growth. The increase in ATR approvals was attributed to new cargo Air Service Licence (ASL) holders, namely World Cargo Airline and M Jets International, which received 9 ATRs from the commission in Q4 of 2021. Mavcom expected the new cargo segment to grow by between 3.9 per cent and 6.7 per cent year-on-year in 2022, translating to between 20.8 and 21.6 billion in freight tonne-kilometres (FTK).", "entities": [{"id": 5460, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 12}}, {"id": 5461, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 47}}, {"id": 5462, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 49, "end_offset": 55}}, {"id": 5463, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 517, "end_offset": 538}}, {"id": 5464, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 543, "end_offset": 570}}, {"id": 5465, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 638, "end_offset": 655}}, {"id": 5466, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 696, "end_offset": 724}}, {"id": 5467, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 774, "end_offset": 787}}, {"id": 5468, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 789, "end_offset": 807}}, {"id": 5469, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 812, "end_offset": 835}}, {"id": 5470, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 879, "end_offset": 909}}, {"id": 5471, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 942, "end_offset": 948}}, {"id": 5472, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1136, "end_offset": 1144}}, {"id": 5473, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1157, "end_offset": 1168}}, {"id": 5474, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1170, "end_offset": 1176}}, {"id": 5475, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1182, "end_offset": 1192}}, {"id": 5476, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 1195, "end_offset": 1213}}, {"id": 5477, "label": "TITLE", "position": {"start_offset": 1214, "end_offset": 1224}}, {"id": 5478, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1247, "end_offset": 1253}}, {"id": 5479, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 1343, "end_offset": 1351}}, {"id": 5480, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 1448, "end_offset": 1461}}, {"id": 5481, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1639, "end_offset": 1645}}, {"id": 5482, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1851, "end_offset": 1870}}, {"id": 5483, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1875, "end_offset": 1895}}, {"id": 5484, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1954, "end_offset": 1960}}, {"id": 5485, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1214, "end_offset": 1241}}, {"id": 5486, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1195, "end_offset": 1241}}, {"id": 5487, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1225, "end_offset": 1241}}], "relations": [{"id": 2545, "head": 5461, "tail": 5462, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2546, "head": 5487, "tail": 5477, "relation": "award received", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2547, "head": 5485, "tail": 5476, "relation": "occupation", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2548, "head": 5486, "tail": 5478, "relation": "Org-Aff.Employment", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 2549, "head": 5486, "tail": 5478, "relation": "chairperson", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2550, "head": 5461, "tail": 5460, "relation": "location", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2551, "head": 5461, "tail": 5460, "relation": "Gen-Aff.Loc-Origin", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 2552, "head": 5462, "tail": 5460, "relation": "location", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2553, "head": 5462, "tail": 5460, "relation": "Gen-Aff.Loc-Origin", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 3164, "head": 5465, "tail": 5467, "relation": "Part-Whole.Subsidary", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 3165, "head": 5465, "tail": 5467, "relation": "subsidiary", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 3166, "head": 5463, "tail": 5468, "relation": "subsidiary", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 3167, "head": 5463, "tail": 5468, "relation": "Part-Whole.Subsidary", "relation_source": "ACE05"}]}, {"id": "article_354", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 3  The ringgit continueditsslide against the US dollar at opening today, as the greenback strengthens furtheramid uncertainties surrounding the Omicron variant, which prompted risk aversion, as well as Federal Reserve's (Fed) continued hawkish statement, dealers said.

'Hopefully, with this study, the understanding of habitats, behaviours, and threats to wildlife, especially Bornean Banteng and Bornean Pygmy Elephant, will increase and serve to assist in providing further plans and strategies in conserving wildlife which is now the main natural treasure of Sabah.   'To further strengthen the efforts made by SET in providing support for the monitoring and enforcement project, SET very much welcomes this cooperation for the sustainability of conservation areas under the supervision of the Yayasan Sabah Group,' he said in his opening speech at the signing of two Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) between SET and Yayasan Sabah Group.   The first signing is for a five-year study on threatened species at Danum Valley, Maliau Basin and Imbak Canyon (DaMaI) conservation areas. The other MoU concerns the appointment of consultants on the formulation of the 10-year Strategic Management Plan for the Silam Coastal Conservation Area (SCCA).  Present were Yayasan Sabah director Datuk Gulamhaidar Khan and Sabah Wildlife director Augustine Tuuga at the ceremony held at the Sabah International Convention Centre here.   According to Augustine, based on surveys five years ago, the elephant population in Sabah is between 1,500 and 2,000, of which about 1,000 of them are mostly found at DaMaI conservation areas.    'It is the same for orangutans, there are about 11,000 found at DaMal. However, the Banteng population is left with 500 which is also at DaMaI, Tabin Forest Reserve and Sugud.    'We are hoping that the population (of these species) will maintain and stabilise, and there is no poaching,' he said, adding that the Sabah Wildlife department had compounded and brought poachers to court which would serve as a deterrent for others.    As for the ongoing population study of orangutan and pygmy elephants with WWF-Malaysia, Augustine said the survey would be conducted outside DaMaI areas.   Gulamhaidar said the MoU would make DaMaI significant in the eyes of the world and will further stimulate the Sabah state government's efforts in obtaining recognition of natural treasures as United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) World Heritage Sites.   'Environmental conservation is an effort that needs to be implemented continuously and requires the mutual support of all parties. The natural treasures of DaMaI that we have today is a trust that we need to preserve for future generations,' he added.   He said the appointment of consultancy services for SCCA will see SET responsible in collecting data, formulating and editing the strategic plan for 2023-2023 including handling scientific expeditions and holding discussions with stakeholders.

The historic moment was witnessed by Johor Mentri Besar Datuk Hasni Mohammad and Malaysian Football League (MFL) president Datuk Ab Ghani Hassan. Meanwhile, outside the stadium, a total of 1,600 supporters' vehicles filled the open parking lot in the stadium area since about 6.30 pm for the 'In-Car Viewing Party'. The programme gave the opportunity to fans who were fully vaccinated againstCovid-19 to watch the match between JDT and KL City live from inside their respective vehicles, through nine giant screens set up. It was held after taking into account the pandemic situation, in full compliancewith standard operating procedures (SOP) set by the Ministry of Health such as checking in using the MySejahtera application and recording their body temperature. To make things sweeter, the JDT team brought the prestigious trophy to the 'In-Car Viewing Party' area on board a roofless busat exactly 11.30pm. On Aug27, a hat-trick by prolific import striker Bergson da Silva sealed the eighth consecutive Super League title for JDT against Sri Pahang FC at the Sultan Ibrahim Stadium, with two games remaining. For the record, Terengganu FC (TFC) was the only team that managed to beat JDT in 22 Super League matches this season.

A coalition of women's groups today demanded for Deputy Minister of Women, Family and Community Development Siti Zailah Mohd Yusoff's resignation for her controversial remark seen to be endorsing domestic violence. In a joint statement, the Joint Action Group for Gender Equality (JAG) said that the comment made by the lawmaker from Islamist party PAS may result in domestic violence being normalised. 'The deputy minister must step down for normalising domestic violence, which is a crime in Malaysia as well as for perpetuating ideas and behaviours that are opposed to gender equality,' it said. 'During the movement control order period in 2020 and 2021 alone there were 9,015 police reports on domestic violence; these statistics may not include reports received by NGOs and other support organisations. 'There is often a stigma and fear attached to reporting domestic violence and this is made worse by statements such as those of Siti Zailah,' it added. The coalition also highlighted the fact that the country is party to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and is, according to the 12th Malaysia Plan, committed to the goal of gender equality in all arenas. 'More importantly, Malaysia has been elected to the United Nations Human Rights Council with the promise of prioritising the rights of vulnerable groups including children and women. 'However, a public statement against gender equality and promoting gender-based violence at the ministerial level is in direct contradiction to this,' it added. Over the weekend, Siti Zailah received backlash for posting a video on social media advising husbands to use a 'gentle but firm physical touch' to reprimand their wives. In a two-minute video, the deputy minister explained different ways of reprimanding their wives and also urged women to be softer with their husbands. Her remark echoes the Quranic verse 4:34, which prescribes men as 'caretakers of women' and can 'discipline them gently' should they be disobedient.

National Unity Minister Datuk Halimah Mohamed Sadique told the Dewan Rakyat this in response to Steven Choong (Tebrau-Independent) who asked whether the ministry had prepared a specific standard operating procedure (SOP) for Chinese New Year temple visits and for the Chingay procession.  'For Thaipusam, we also had applications for silver chariot processions but it was disallowed due to the emergence of the new variant,' she said, adding that this decision could be overturned by higher decision making bodies within the National Security Council (NSC).  Earlier, Halimah told V. Sivakumar (Batu Gajah- PH) that the ministry had already prepared the SOPs related to the festivals and called 10 religious leaders from Selangor, Perak, Kedah, Perak, Kuala Lumpur and Johor for an engagement session with the NSC and the Health Ministry on Dec 2.  She said that the SOPs which were tweaked to incorporate the input of the leaders would be raised at three higher level committee meetings.  For the first layer, it would have to be vetted by the Technical Working Group Pandemic Management meeting on Dec 13 and chaired by the NSC.  'The SOPs will then be raised at the quartet meeting , chaired by the Defence Minister which is scheduled to be held on Dec 14 before it is brought to the Special Committee Meeting on the Management of the Pandemic chaired by the Prime Minister on Dec 15. When all this is completed I will send out the finalised SOPs to religious leaders and prepare a press statement.'  Halimah also held up a copy of the SOPs prepared so far in the house as proof.  She also said that among the seven aspects discussed was the establishment of stalls for traders at temples during the festival.  'These stalls can be set up by traders as long as they get clearance from the local councils.'  Meanwhile Halimah said that the SOPs for any celebrations are prepared two months prior to the event.  'I guarantee there are no issues with the preparation of SOPs for any celebration in Malaysia in line with the Keluarga Malaysia concept,' she said, adding that the SOPs for Christmas had been prepared and it was due to engage with religious leaders on Dec 14.  The Silver Chariot processions were banned nationwide in 2021. Large scale movement restrictions also curbed people from participating in the festival and marking their penance by bearing kavadis, milk pots and thronging the Batu Caves temple complex.

Bursa said it would be defending its position vigorously and would not abdicate its statutory roles and functions in the marketplace. 'Timely disclosure of material information is a key pillar of ensuring the market is well informed of the information and all investors are treated equally and able to trade on equal footing in terms of parity of disclosures. 'This is paramount to enable Bursa Securities to discharge its statutory duty,' the stock exchange said in a statement yesterday. The statement was issued after Bursa had been served with legal papers on Nov 3 which included an originating summons and notice of application for an interim injunction by Serba Dinamik. Bursa has engaged a legal counsel for advice on the matter and its next course of action while the application for interim injunctive relief is fixed for hearing on Nov 11 and the case management for the originating summons is set for Nov 17. Serba Dinamik and Bursa are locking horns after the latter demanded the oil and gas company to disclose details from the factual findings update as at Sept 30 on the special independent review communicated to three out of four independent non-executive directors on Oct 21. Bursa subsequently suspended the trading of Serba Dinamik's securities on Oct 22. It also issued an ultimatum to Serba Dinamik to reveal the findings from the independent review on Oct 26 but was met with a denial. Serba Dinamik, meanwhile, had insisted that its directors had not been given a 'factual findings update' by independent auditor Ernst & Young Consulting Sdn Bhd.

Health director-general Tan Sri Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said of the new infections, 3,631 were local cases (3,516 Malaysians and 31 foreigners), while the remaining 366 cases were imported (335 Malaysians and 31 foreigners).  He further said out of the new cases reported, only 64 cases or 1.6 per cent were in Categories 3, 4, and 5.  The remaining 3,933 (98.4 per cent), he said were asymptomatic or those with mild symptoms under Categories 1 and 2.  'A total of 281 patients are being treated in the intensive care units, including 155 on ventilator support.  'A total of 3,984 patients have recovered, raising the cumulative number of recoveries to 2,681,390 as of today,' he said in a statement today.  Meanwhile, Dr Noor Hisham said the nation's R-naught (Rt) stood at 0.95 as of Dec 29.  He said Kelantan had the highest Rt at 1.01, followed by Terengganu with 1.00, Johor (0.97), Kedah and Putrajaya (0.94), Perak (0.93), Selangor and Melaka (0.92), Penang (0.91), Pahang (0.90), Kuala Lumpur and Perlis (0.89), Negri Sembilan (0.88), Sabah (0.87), Labuan (0.73) and Sarawak (0.71).  Rt refers to the infectivity rate of a virus and the ability of a positive patient to transmit it to others.  On new clusters, Dr Noor Hisham said another three clusters were identified today. He said there are 221 active clusters nationwide of the total 6,123 clusters recorded to date.  He said detailed information and breakdown of cases will be uploaded to the ministry's CovidNow portal at https://covidnow.moh.gov.my, with the data being updated at midnight daily.  Meanwhile, the Health Ministry has detected another 71 cases of infectious diseases among flood victims.  Dr Noor Hisham said from the total, 21 were acute respiratory infection (ARI) cases, 30 suffering from skin diseases, 13 identified with food poisoning or acute gastroenteritis (AGE) and two with Hand Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD).  He said as of 3pm today, the number of Covid-19 cases reported among flood victims stood at 442 cases.  'There are 15 positive cases among flood victims at temporary evacuation centres.  'No new clusters were reported while at PPS.'  Currently, the number of flood victims recorded by the government stands at 6,348.

The ministry also advised all involved in any evacuation exercise to use personal protective gear such as gloves, boots and life-saving jackets. MoH said people must cleanse themselves with clean water if they have come into contact with flood waters. It added that they must also wash their hands properly and always uphold high standard of hygiene practices. 'Do not shower yourself or wash anything or food items using flood waters, but always go for clean water and bottled water for drinking and wash food items.' The ministry also urged all to keep evacuation centres clean and hygienic so as to avoid turning them into breeding ground for flies and rats. It advised all to use personal protective gear such as gloves and boots when they are engaged in post-floods cleaning. 'Do not hesitate to seek medical attention if you experience a fever within 30 days after the cleaning task,' added MoH.

The integrated steel manufacturer said this was buoyed by the recovery in selling prices of steel products in local and international markets. Masteel said prices of iron ore, a primary raw material for blast furnace-based steel making which is a bellwether for steel demand, rose from a low of US$85 per tonne in November 2021 to more than US$150 per tonne on February 11, 2022, before settling at US$143 per tonne in the fourth week of February. At the same time, price of metallurgical coal, which constitutes 40 per cent of blast furnace cost of production, remained high year to date. Masteel's revenue during the period increased 14.2 per cent to RM1.58 billion from RM1.38 billion. Masteel said the growth in revenue was bolstered by the Malaysian market where sales rose 15.8 per cent to RM1.4 billion from RM1.3 billion previously on stronger demand from the construction sector. Export sales remained stable at RM136.1 million in FY21, versus RM137.3 million a year ago. Masteel managing director and chief executive officer Datuk Sri Tai Hean Leng remained upbeat on the company's prospects, particularly as the stronger demand for steel from the accelerated pace of economic activities globally was expected to overshadow the impact of uptrending raw material prices. He said the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe was not expected to have any impact on the company's earnings. 'This strong turnaround, is made even more significant against the backdrop of the disruptive Movement Control Orders in FY21, and showcases our resilience. 'We are also reaping the benefits of the timely upgrading of our steel making facilities. 'Although prices of raw materials are increasing, the greater force of external demand is widely expected to eclipse the high-cost environment,' he said. Tai added that North Asia's commencement of the civil construction period in the spring, together with the lifting of restrictions of steel mill activities in China, was prompting a strong rebound in domestic and international steel prices. 'With our large capacity and reliable delivery network, we are confident of capturing this demand wave,' he said.

He said the former vice president had expressed his wish to do so several times since he was charged in court, but that he was nevertheless sad Peter and another assemblyman left the party. 'I sympathise because he (Peter) has already expressed his intentions several times following the court case he is facing 'The action of Limbahau assemblyman, Datuk Juil Nuatim, is also unfortunate because he was influenced by Peter, which caused him to take a hasty decision,' he said in a statement today. Shafie also said Peter, the Melalap assemblyman who announced that he will set up another multi-racial party in collaboration with Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS), will only further divide the people of Sabah and the community in the interior. 'In a press conference, Peter said a state should be governed by local political parties according to their respective states. 'However, this contradicts his move to join the GRS which consists of national parties and local parties,' he said. Shafie also denied Peter's claim that Warisan has strayed far from the original struggle when it expanded to Peninsular Malaysia. 'Since its inception, Warisan has been vocal in fighting for the rights of Sabah and Sarawak enshrined in the 1963 Malaysia Agreement until the recent amendment to the Constitution to restore its status as an ally of the Peninsula. 'The reason for leaving the party because Warisan strayed from the original struggle just because it spread its wings to the Peninsula, is untrue. 'This is because at the previous Supreme Council meeting and the Heritage Party (2020) Annual General Assembly on December 12, all members of the supreme council and party members fully supported the move at the rally. 'The decision to expand Warisan to the Peninsula is a move to offer another option to all voters in Malaysia,' he said. Yesterday, Peter and Juil announced their decision to leave the party, saying they will set up a new party supporting GRS, which is led by Perikatan Nasional. In the state election last year, Warisan and Pakatan Harapan only won 32 seats compared to GRS that won 38. Warisan has already lost three state seats after the departures of Datuk Mohamaddin Ketapi (Segama), Hassan A. Gani Pg Amir (Sebatik) and Yusof Yacob (Sindumin). Both Mohamadin and Hassan joined Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu) to support Hajiji while Yusof remained an independent asemblyman friendly with Peter is also facing charges of using false

accounts have been suspended due to the financial institution's error.  Civil Disobedient Mindset Movement promoter from Agenda Reset Malaysia (ARM) Datuk Dr Mohd Ramalan Yunus said thousands of banking customers had their accounts frozen since Jan 24 due to a technical glitch.  He said affected customers were given the runaround and passed from one department to the other when they called to inquire about their frozen account details.  Speaking at a press conference with some of the victims at Villa Puteri Condominium here this evening, Ramalan said duplicate and redundant transactions should not take so long to rectify.  Ramalan said since the bank was governed by Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) and BNM by the Finance ministry and the ministry by the Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob, he should intervene and resolve the issue.  Malaysian Muslim Consumers Association (PPIM) lead activist Datuk Nadzim Johan said so far they have received more than 3,300 complaints from the bank's customers and police reports have been attached to each complaint.  'Although PPIM received over 3,000 complaints on this matter, we believe there are at least another 11,000 whose bank accounts remain frozen, 11 days after the glitch,' he said.  He said it has been 11 days since the glitch happened and they were still receiving complaints from account holders whose bank accounts were still frozen.  'How do you expect these persons to pay their bills and survive. How much longer should we wait, before the matter is rectified by the bank,' he asked.  It was reported that CIMB on its Facebook page posted guidelines on protecting user accounts on Jan 24, following the glitch.  The bank urged customers to change their passwords periodically, safeguard personal information and check their transactions regularly so they do not fall victim to scams.  The bank had said the error led to an unspecified number of customers encountering duplicate transactions.  'We have noted a processing error which has led to a small number of customers receiving duplicate credits in their accounts.  'We are reaching out to these customers to ensure a fair and managed resolution,' CIMB had said.  The bank said the processing error involved its 'Money Send' service, which led to the duplication of fund transfers to their account.", "entities": [{"id": 5923, "label": "LOCATION", "position":

men's slalom event at the Yanqing National Alpine Ski Centre, today. Jeffrey, the first Malaysian athlete to make two appearances at the Winter Olympics after his debut in the 2018 edition in PyeongChang, South Korea, fell at the beginning of the Run 1 competition which prevented him from continuing in the event (classified as Did Not Finish (DNF). The classification denied him the chance to compete in Run 2 to continue his challenge for the overall best position. The result saw the 23-year-old US-based athlete suffer misfortune for the second time in a row after failing to finish in the same event four years ago. 'Jeffrey has tried his best but luck was not on his side. We thank him for flying Malaysia's flag at the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022. 'We hope Jeffrey will continue to train hard and come back stronger at the next Milano Cortina Winter Olympics 2026,' Malaysia's Chef-de-Mission (CDM) to Beijing 2022, Moira Tan said in a post on the Olympic Council of Malaysia's (OCM) Facebook page. Before this, national Alpine skier Aruwin Idami Salehhuddin, who made her Winter Olympics debut at this Games, ended her challenge in the women's giant slalom event by being in the top 40 on February 7. However, two days later, fate was not on the 17-year-old's side in her second event, the women's slalom, when the Colorado-based skier failed to finish it after falling on Run 1. Only the duo represented Malaysia at this prestigious Games which is scheduled to end on February 20. Meanwhile, Jeffrey, through a video clip the Olympic Council of Malaysia (OCM) shared with the media, said he felt a little disappointed at failing to make headway in the men's slalom event. 'Today, it didn't go as well as I (had) hoped (for) but I am happy with how I trained leading up to this event. I would like to thank everybody for their kind words and support I hope to continue in the future,' he said.", "entities": [{"id": 5957, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 12}}, {"id": 5958, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 30}}, {"id": 5959, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 50, "end_offset": 78}}, {"id": 5960, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 109, "end_offset": 121}}, {"id": 5961, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 122, "end_offset": 134}}, {"id": 5962, "label": "FACILITY", "position": {"start_offset": 191, "end_offset": 225}}, {"id": 5963, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 234, "end_offset": 241}}, {"id": 5964, "label": "NORP", "position": {"start_offset": 253, "end_offset": 262}}, {"id": 5965, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 302, "end_offset": 317}}, {"id": 5966, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 357, "end_offset": 368}}, {"id": 5967, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 370, "end_offset": 381}}, {"id": 5968, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 665, "end_offset": 667}}, {"id": 5969, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 869, "end_offset": 877}}, {"id": 5970, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 892, "end_offset": 912}}, {"id": 5971, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 936, "end_offset": 943}}, {"id": 5972, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 1007, "end_offset": 1037}}, {"id": 5973, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1045, "end_offset": 1053}}, {"id": 5974, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 1081, "end_offset": 1093}}, {"id": 5975, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1095, "end_offset": 1104}}, {"id": 5976, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1127, "end_offset": 1154}}, {"id": 5977, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1158, "end_offset": 1161}}, {"id": 5978, "label": "PRODUCT", "position": {"start_offset": 1163, "end_offset": 1171}}, {"id": 5979, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 1200, "end_offset": 1212}}, {"id": 5980, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1213, "end_offset": 1237}}, {"id": 5981, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 1252, "end_offset": 1267}}, {"id": 5982, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1495, "end_offset": 1509}}, {"id": 5983, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1585, "end_offset": 1593}}, {"id": 5984, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 1614, "end_offset": 1619}}, {"id": 5985, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1673, "end_offset": 1680}}, {"id": 5986, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1707, "end_offset": 1734}}, {"id": 5987, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1736, "end_offset": 1739}}, {"id": 5988, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 109, "end_offset": 134}}, {"id": 5989, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 1056, "end_offset": 1071}}, {"id": 5990, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 1073, "end_offset": 1076}}, {"id": 5991, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1200, "end_offset": 1237}}], "relations": [{"id": 2983, "head": 5957, "tail": 5958, "relation": "capital of", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2984, "head": 5961, "tail": 5960, "relation": "occupation", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2985, "head": 5961, "tail": 5963, "relation": "given name", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2988, "head": 5988, "tail": 5964, "relation": "Gen-Aff.CRRE", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 2989, "head": 5988, "tail": 5958, "relation": "country for sport", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2987, "head": 5964, "tail": 5958, "relation": "Gen-Aff.CRRE", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 2990, "head": 5966, "tail": 5967, "relation": "Part-Whole.Geo", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 2991, "head": 5976, "tail": 5977, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2992, "head": 5980, "tail": 5979, "relation": "occupation", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2993, "head": 5991, "tail": 5981, "relation": "participant", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2994, "head": 5988, "tail": 5965, "relation": "participant", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2995, "head": 5989, "tail": 5990, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2996, "head": 5975, "tail": 5989, "relation": "occupation", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 2997, "head": 5975, "tail": 5990, "relation": "occupation", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 3180, "head": 5986, "tail": 5987, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}]}, {"id": "article_367", "text": "Former international Datuk James Selvaraj (pic) will not blame the national badminton squad if they fall short in their bid to bring back a medal from the Tokyo Olympics later this month. According to James, the players are already under tremendous pressure to perform in Japan due to the Covid-19 pandemic that continues to wreak havoc in most parts of the world, including Malaysia. Since the pandemic hit full-scale last year, Malaysian shuttlers have had no choice but to train behind closed doors in a safe bubble at the Academy Badminton Malaysia (ABM) in Bukit Kiara. With limited tournament experience and top-quality sparring over the last one year, James will understand if the team fail to produce their best in Tokyo. 'Let's face it, the players bound for Tokyo are already under tremendous pressure. And this is not pressure coming from badminton but by a virus that continues to cause so many problems. 'Sure, our athletes have all been vaccinated, but that does not guarantee anyone from getting the virus. 'With so many restrictions and rules from swab tests, to no mingling with others, no physical contact and quarantine, how do you expect a player to perform? 'I don't even understand why the Games this year is still going ahead.  'Just look at the Euros. Reports are already coming out that it is a Covid-19 hotspot as  fans tested positive after watching the matches at stadiums. 'This is how I feel,' James told Timesport recently. This year, Malaysia will be represented in all five disciplines. Those who have qualified are Lee Zii Jia (men's singles), Aaron Chia-Soh Wooi Yik (men's doubles), Soniia Cheah (women's singles), Chow Mei Kuan-Lee Meng Yean (women's doubles) and 2016 Rio Olympics silver medallists Chan Peng Soon-Goh Liu Ying (mixed doubles).

In a statement today, the Maybank group said the improved PATAMI was due to lower provisions, declining cost of funds and overhead costs, as well as a strong performance from the Shariah banking unit, as gradual economic recovery in Indonesia took place amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, net interest income (NII) decreased by two per cent to 7.12 trillion rupiah in December 2021 from 7.26 trillion rupiah in the previous year, impacted by lower loan growth and a decreasing trend in loan yield, in line with the reduction in Bank Indonesia rates and ongoing restructuring of customers' loans impacted by the pandemic. However, Maybank said, net interest margin rose by 14 basis points to 4.7 per cent in December 2021, attributed to the improvements in the cost of funds and healthy growth of the current account savings account. Maybank Indonesia's fee-based income declined 12.1 per cent to 2.09 trillion rupiah in the period under review from 2.38 trillion rupiah in the previous year, primarily due to declining global markets-related fees, it said. 'However, the bank was able to maintain the growth momentum and strengthen its retail-related income such as bancassurance, which grew by 26.9 per cent to 201 billion rupiah in December 2021 from 158 billion rupiah in the previous year. 'Despite the squeeze in the bank's NII and lower fee-based income, the net profit grew by almost 30 per cent as provisioning costs tapered due to pre-emptive provisioning, which was made in previous years along with well-contained overhead costs,' it shared. Maybank Indonesia had taken conservative measures since 2020 to set aside provisions for accounts, across all business segments, impacted by the challenging economic environment and also continued its efforts to assist customers facing challenges and focused on credit restructuring to safeguard asset quality. 'This pre-emptive provisioning combined with positive improvement from the restructuring during the year has now contributed to a drop in loan-loss provisions by 25.8 per cent to 1.54 trillion rupiah,' the group said. The bank's consolidated non-performing loans (NPL) ratio stood at 3.7 per cent (gross) and 2.6 per cent (net) in December 2021 from four per cent (gross) and 2.5 per cent (net) in December 2020, supported by lower NPL balances, which declined by 10.8 per cent. According to Maybank, the Indonesian operation maintained a prudent banking approach and kept its risk posture at a healthy level to ensure asset quality remained sound. Maybank Indonesia president director Taswin Zakaria said 2021 remained a challenging year for the bank, given the second wave of Covid-19. 'Nevertheless, government campaigns on vaccination programme and implementation of health protocols helped to speed up the recovery towards the last quarter of 2021. We are optimistic that public optimism and economic recovery momentum will continue in 2022, although challenges remain. 'Amidst the uncertainties, we remain prudent in running our banking business to maintain the bank's fundamentals and at the same time, we look forward to optimising our acquisition efforts across our businesses by strengthening productivity and collaboration among various banking services, to deliver value for customers, as reflected in our mission, Humanising Financial Services,' he said.

The Johor Umno chief, however, said that decision has yet to be finalised. 'If given the chance, I would like to contest in Benut again,' he told reporters after handing out Chinese New Year contributions to Benut constituents here today. Hasni has been the incumbent for Benut since the 12th general election (GE12) in 2008 and in GE14, he defeated Bersatu's Zulkifly Tasrep and Mohd Firdaus Jaafar (PAS) with a majority of 4,447 votes. On talk that Selangor Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Amirudin Shari's younger brother, Aziz Shari, 33, will be contesting in Benut as well, Hasni merely replied: 'The more the merrier'. Meanwhile, Hasni, who is also Johor Barisan Nasional (BN) chairman, said BN will field younger candidates to keep up with changes and current demands. The coalition is currently in the process of identifying suitable candidates, he said. 'Umno and BN are not static, (we) keep pace with changes. These days, the people want younger candidates and new faces, and we will not ignore these calls for the sake of a stable Johor government,' he said. On Puteri Wangsa assemblyman Mazlan Bujang's decision to quit Bersatu, Hasni hoped Mazlan will continue to be active in politics. 'In the 24 months he (Mazlan) held the position of Johor Education, Information, Heritage and Culture Committee chairman, I feel he has understood the way Umno and BN work. I think Mazlan has seen for himself the understanding we have and (that has) made him confident to support BN, Umno and my leadership,' he said. At the same event, Umno secretary-general Datuk Seri Ahmad Maslan also confirmed that he will be not contesting in the state election to enable him to focus on his parliamentary duties.", "entities":

Wei Chong-Kai Wun were part of Malaysia's Badminton Asia Team Championships (BATC) winning team.  World No 11 Yew Sin-Ee Yi were not picked for the biennial event, which concluded in Shah Alam on Sunday. 'We have been discussing that (Thomas Cup squad), and we already have plans,' said Rexy. 'We cannot forget Yew Sin-Ee Yi because we also have the Sea Games going on at the same time. 'They will be under consideration because we have to strengthen our team. 'We will give a chance to Wei Chong-Kai Wun to prove (themselves) at the Sea Games, which have team and individual categories. 'They will likely be facing the same players that competed here (BATC).  The young Indonesian players competing here will also likely play in the Sea Games.' The Thomas Cup will be held in Bangkok on May 8-15, while the Vietnam Sea Games will run from May 12-23. Despite their misfiring performances at the BATC, Rexy added that he was still happy with the determination shown by national No 1 pair Aaron Chia-Soh Wooi Yik. The Olympic bronze medallists and world no 7 laboured to three-set wins against their South Korean and Indonesian counterparts in the semi-final and final of the BATC. 'They struggled, but I am proud that they were still able to overcome their difficulties in two important matches (semi-final and final) and win, despite not being at their very best,' said Rexy.

"text": "KUALA LUMPUR: A total of 19 SmartTAG and hybrid SmartTAG-Touch 'n Go lanes will be operational in 16 key toll plazas along the North-South Expressway (NSE) by Jan 25. Plus Malaysia Bhd strategic stakeholder engagement head Syed Mohammed Idid said this follows complaints on traffic crawls and SmartTAG users' grievances on being caught off guard. He said that the move would cater to the lanes that were removed to expedite the rollout of the RFID on the NSE from Juru to Skudai as part of the second pilot on the system's implementation by the operator. 'Subsequently, on Feb 19, post Chinese New Year, an additional 18 more toll plazas will convert 24 lanes to SmartTAG lanes.' In a statement, the highway operator also said that it had committed teams to work round-the-clock on the ground to optimise the system's performance and sharpen the detection of RFID at all toll plazas.  'Quicker 'double arm' lane barriers will also be deployed at plazas with high traffic to ensure traffic will be able to be managed and cleared quickly. Additionally, to assist our highway customers, visual RFID detection zones will be painted on the lanes to ensure customers are able to position their vehicle to ensure optimum detection. 'On-the-ground personnel would also be deployed, where customer service assistants (CSAs) will be at all 158 RFID lanes across 74 toll plazas to assist customers who are stuck at the lanes using portable detection devices.  'Strategic fitment centres for RFID tag fitment and replacement are also available.' So far there are 24 fitment centres (FC) established on Plus highways and 35 at locations outside Plus highways.  'The full list of FCs can be obtained and updated from time to time at https://rfidregister.touchngo.com.my/fitment-centres. Customers experiencing detection issues at Plus highways will receive a Touch 'n Go coupon from our CSA and can proceed to the nearest fitment centre and Touch 'n Go will replace the tag for free if found faulty.  'Plus will continue to work with Touch 'n Go to increase the number of RFID fitment centres to ensure proper tag fitting by a professional fitment agent is available to customers,' Plus said. For detailed information on the location of the Touch 'n Go RFID tag installation, highway customers can visit the Touch 'n Go portal at http://www.touchngo.com.my or the Plus official website, www.plus.com.my and social media platforms including Twitter PLUSTrafik, Plus Malaysia Facebook as well as the Plus App.  The highway operator earlier apologised to all highway users for the inconvenience caused in the wake of traffic snarls caused by the removal of SmartTAG lanes and faulty RFID tags. Earlier Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob said road users must be given the option of using either the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) system, Touch 'n Go card, or SmartTAG at toll gates. He said this was decided by the Cabinet, which in its meeting yesterday, was of the view that road users must be given a choice, just like how it was practiced when Touch 'n Go was introduced in its early years and cash payments were still allowed to continue. Under the Works Ministry's Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) blueprint to drive down congestion on highways, the Multi-Lane Free Flow (MLFF) or gateless or boothless toll collection systems were slated to be implemented fully by 2026 via the RFID mechanism.  Ismail Sabri said the RFID, which was introduced to speed up travelling time, was a good suggestion but motorists must also be given an option since the RFID was a pioneer project and would need time to be fine-tuned.", "entities": [{"id": 6213, "label": "PRODUCT", "position": {"start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 36}}, {"id": 6214, "label": "PRODUCT", "position": {"start_offset": 41, "end_offset":

standard chicken by 20 sen from  the current ceiling price of RM9.10.  Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob, who chaired the meeting today, said apart from chicken prices, the price of chicken eggs will remain the same as stated under the present Malaysian Maximum Family Price Scheme (SHMKM) control list items.   'The implementation of these two prices will be effective from Feb 5 until June 5, 2022,' he said.   The government will provide subsidies to ensure that the price of goods can be controlled.  'The subsidy details are being studied by a special team on National Cost of Living led by the Agriculture and Food Industries Ministry and several other ministries, representatives of government linked companies (GLCs) and consumer associations until prices stabilise.  'We have also opened the whole chicken importation permit to all Approval Permit (AP) holders to import chicken, as compared to previously when they get could only import pieces such as wings, thighs and so on,' he  said, adding that hypermarket operators currently could also apply for APs to import chicken.   Ismail Sabri also urged the Malaysian Competition Commission (MYCC) to investigate if there is a cartel involved in a pact to determine the price of chicken and eggs.  He said the implementation of the Malaysian Family Sales Programme (PJKM) involving all 222 parliamentary constituencies nationwide must be revived with cooperation from multiple ministries.  He said this would ensure that Malaysian families were able to get basic goods at cheaper prices.   For this, he added fair price stores should also be revived throughout the country, and agreed that the frequency of farmers 'market or 'pasar tani' should  be increased in stages.   'The meeting has also instructed the Finance Ministry  to study incentives and taxes affecting the transformation of poultry farms.  'From now, agricultural industry cooperatives will be involved directly in basic goods management. There are no more middlemen to control goods prices,' he added in a statement.  Ismail Sabri said apart from the short-term solutions mentioned above, the meeting discussed long-term measures such as support for research carried out by the Malaysian Agricultural Research and Development Institute (Mardi) to make oil palm fillet in place of corn and soy as chicken feed and to propose to state governments to extend the period of land use under temporary occupation licence (TOL) for agricultural activities.   'We also discussed food security issues on whether it's sufficient, and how to make sure Malaysian families can afford to buy them.

Revenue, however, edged up 0.3 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) to RM1.58 billion as postpaid revenue strengthened 1.1 per cent to RM633 million, the highest in five quarters, the mobile service provider said. '(The higher postpaid revenue reflected) our strategic efforts to drive data monetisation as well as delivering sustainable subscriber and revenue mix. As such, Internet and digital revenue mix strengthened to 77.5 per cent service revenue,' it said in a filing with Bursa Malaysia today. Prepaid revenue fell 3.4 per cent y-o-y to RM645 million. Digi said favourable take-ups for mobile bundles further lifted y-o-y device sales growth by 17.6 per cent as devices sold rose to 353,000 units. In a press statement, the company said it invested RM170 million in network capacity enhancements and digitalisation of operations during the quarter under review as part of the company's priority to deliver a quality Internet experience to its customers in meeting the rising data consumption. 'Monthly average data usage now stands at 22.4 gigabytes per user,' it said. Digi has declared a third interim dividend of four sen per share (Q3 2020: 4.1 sen), which will be paid on Dec 17, while the entitlement date is on Nov 18. The telecommunication company said it delivered 100 per cent of its targets for new 4G sites rollout and site upgrades under the National Digital Network initiative (JENDELA) plan in the quarter to further strengthen its network. 'The process to gradually shut down the 3G network is progressing well with less than 300,000 3G-subscribers, against a growing internet subscribers base of nine million,' it said. On prospects, Digi said that it would continue to execute its strategy focusing on strengthening mobile offerings and digital services for subscribers to benefit from growing digital opportunities, as well as to expand the widest network coverage in rural areas. 'As the operating and retail environment is gradually returning to normal conditions, Digi is revising the financial year 2021 guidance to low single-digit decline for service revenue, low-to-mid single-digit decline for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) and capex-to-total revenue ratio of 13.0 per cent to 14.0 per cent,' it said. It also noted that the proposed transaction relating to the prior-announced proposed merger between Celcom Axiata Bhd and Digi Telecommunications Sdn Bhd is progressing as planned.

country's oldest association for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) said the hike in electricity tariff surcharge for non-domestic users from next month until June this year will hamper the industry's recovery from the economic impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. Small and Medium Enterprises Association of Malaysia (Samenta) chairman, Datuk William Ng cautioned that if the proposed surcharge continued as planned, it will be difficult, if not impossible, for businesses to absorb it without passing it partially to consumers. 'While we have and will continue to urge our members to refrain from raising prices despite this steep hike in electricity bills and costs of raw materials, we must also understand that most SMEs are already operating on a razor thin margin and struggling to find their footing amidst the pandemic,' he said in a statement today. He was referring to the electricity tariff surcharge of 3.7 sen per kilowatt hour (kWh) for non-domestic users for the February until June 2022 period as announced by the Energy Commission yesterday. Based on the Energy Commission and Tenaga Nasional Bhd's (TNB) own numbers, Ng said more than 1.6 million commercial and industrial users will be paying between 11.8 to 18.4 percent more for electricity from Feb 1. 'For most SMEs, especially those in the manufacturing sector, electricity is the second or third largest cost factor, behind raw materials and labour costs.  'A hike of up 18.4 percent in utility bill for a business that's running at sub-10 percent margin could mean a reduction of between 20 to 40 in its profits, and could even mean a difference between making and losing money,' he said. Although Samenta understands the need for periodic adjustments in prices, Ng said the association, however, could not accept the quantum or the timing of the imposition of the surcharge. Ng said this is especially so since TNB reported a 9.6 percent and 4.6 percent jump in revenue and earnings respectively for the nine months ending Sept 30 last year. He also cited a media report which quoted TNB president and chief executive officer Datuk Ir Baharin Din saying that demand is expected to improve in the coming months and into this year as more economic activities open for business. 'As such by TNB's own admission, the national utility company will be doing better in coming months. 'And there are no reason for the steep hike, especially since it is aspiring to cut down its reliance on coal in its portfolio from 45 percent in 2021 to 10 percent by 2035, with the costs of coal stock chiefly blamed for the steep hike,' Ng said. Therefore, Samenta, said Ng, has urged Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob to keep his promise by intervening in the issue and rescue ailing SMEs. If the hike must be allowed, Samenta urge the Cabinet to consider a far lower quantum of increment without affecting TNB's continued profitability or it's 'resilient performance'.", "entities":

 The Ministry of Rural Development (KPLB) has received about 80 per cent of the list of houses, roads and public facilities affected by floods in rural areas so far. Its minister Datuk Seri Mahdzir Khalid said therefore, the district officers responsible for the remaining data must act on it immediately within the stipulated period. 'For projects affected by floods in rural areas, the reporting comes from the district office where the district officer is the chairman of the district Flood Operations Control Centre (PKOB). 'He prepares the list to be sent to the ministry. So far, we have received (data of this) for repairs and building of new houses. (Hence) We can attend to it, because we have a budget of RM50 million for flood relief works,' he said. He said this when met by reporters after a meeting with KPLB agency directors and the presentation of contributions for the Mara Education Foundation (YPM) at the Muar Community Development Department (Kemas) office here today. He said so far 1,700 houses had been rebuilt under the RM50 million allocated for house repairs. 'Meanwhile, RM50 million has been allocated to repair rural link roads (JPD) and another RM50 million slated for rebuilding social amenities (PAMS) in states affected by the recent floods,' he said. Earlier at the ceremony, Mahdzir presented the contributions under YPM's corporate social responsibility (CSR) programme to 401 students from four educational institutions under MARA (Majlis Amanah Rakyat) who were affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.

'Today I attended at the central police station to answer numerous reports lodged against me concerning those videos. 'I am being investigated under Section 505 (b) of the Penal Code which carries a prison term of up to two years or fine or both,' she said in a statement. According to Lau, the videos were educational as all the information on independence were obtained through the internet. She claimed that there was no incitement of any kind in her TikTok videos. She said she spoke on Sarawak's right to independence through Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) in the videos. 'I also spoke on Malaya's independence in 1957 from Great Britain and Singapore's independence in 1965 through the separation from Malaysia.

I will continue to stand on the side of Sarawak and speak on her right to independence,' she said.

Feb 23  Harimau Malaya's new head coach Kim Pan-gon today confirmed that he has picked Sarawak United FC head coach E Elavarasan to be his local assistant coach of the national football squad. The South Korean through a statement from the Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) said that Elavarasan met the criteria he needed  a coach who is familiar with the players and possesses vast experience in the domestic scene. 'After studying the candidates who had been earlier interviewed by FAM technical director Scott O'Donell, I personally met Elavarasan. I believe he is the best candidate and the most suitable individual to assist me in providing accurate information and opinions on the team. 'I can see Elavarasan is a committed coach who is geared up to give his full cooperation in helping us to take Harimau Malaya to a higher level,' Pan-gon said on the former Selangor and Public Bank defender. Elavarasan, 60, who holds the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Pro Licence (from 2018), has been in charge of Sarawak United since February 2020, and steered the Golden Hornbills to gain Super League promotion by finishing runners-up to Negri Sembilan in the 2021 Premier League. Meanwhile, Elavarasan, who is going to get involved in the FAM set-up for the first time, considers the opportunity as a huge honour and a national duty. 'I see this assignment as a challenge and also the opportunity for me to contribute at the national level, happy to be part of this new project. My hope is that the coaching team is able to adapt quickly to the head coach's work ethics and philosophy ahead of a few major tournaments this year. 'I wish to thank Sarawak United for giving me an early release from my contract and not forgetting the players and the fans who had given their fullest cooperation to me throughout my stint at Sarawak United,' he said. Pan-gon during his first press conference on February 17 after reporting to FAM, had unveiled his coaching team comprising of assistant coach Pau Marti Vicente, Cho Junho (goalkeeper coach), Dr Gokhan Kandemir (fitness coach) and Lim Jaehun (performance analyst). The new coaching team has scheduled to convene the first centralised training camp for the Harimau Malaya on March 14 ahead of two Tier 1 International Friendly Matches against the Philippines on March 23 and Singapore on March 26. Both matches will be held in Singapore.

However, he added that this activity had so far not been detected at the turtle landing area. 'The land is privately owned, so we cannot prevent its owner to carry out activities on that piece of land except for removing the sand without a licence,' he said when contacted, here, today. Earlier, two environmental non-governmental organisations (NGO) urged the mentri besar to take stern action against the alleged ongoing illegal sand mining activity at the Pasir Panjang beach in Manjung. The two NGOs are Sahabat Alam Malaysia (SAM) and Persatuan Aktivis Sahabat Alam (KUASA). SAM's field researcher Meor Razak Meor Abdul Rahman said it had been observed that this activity was still going on, ignoring the prohibition by the relevant authorities. 'Therefore, I urge that the mentri besar as the state executive councillor in charge on the land, forestry and natural resources portfolio and as chairman of the State Planning Committee as well as a member of the National Physical Planning Council pay attention to this issue and take action against those involved,' he said in a statement, here, today. Meanwhile, director of the Perak Land and Mines Office, Datuk Mohamad Fariz Mohamad Hanip, when contacted, said that it had asked all the relevant departments including the Marine Department, Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency and marine police to monitor the area involved to ensure no removal of sand from it. 'We have also issued a letter to the land owner not to remove the sand from there. However, works carried out on the land involving cleaning up are the owner's right except for development work that requires approval from the Manjung Municipal Council. 'The situation is under full control and I believe the land owner will not remove the sand from the area without approval as it only hamper the next process including selling the sand. On January 3, Mohamad Fariz reportedly said that sand mining at the site had been detected since last November and with the cooperation of the Manjung Municipal Council, it was ordered to stop while waiting for approval. He said that on checking the application, the company involved wished to develop the area as it had the potential for mining of sand for silica.", "entities": [{"id": 6683, "label": "LOCATION",

He will be taking over from his mother, Datuk Amar Jamilah Anu, in contest for the Tanjong Datu seat.  Meanwhile, Abang Johari who is a nine-term Satok assemblyman said he will not be defending his seat, instead, he will be contesting in Gedong.  Pesaka Bumiputera Bersatu (PBB) supreme council member Datuk Ibrahim Baki will be contesting in Satok.  'Yes, I am going to (contest in) Gedong,' he told the reporters after the handover of 'surat watikah' (appointment letters) to all GPS candidates at the Parti Pesaka Bumiputera Bersatu (PBB) headquarters in Jalan Bako here this afternoon.  Abang Johari who is the Chief Minister also announced that Progressive Democratic Party (PDP) president Datuk Seri Tiong King Sing, also the Bintulu member of Parliament MP and Special Envoy of the Prime Minister will be contesting for the Dudong stat seat.  Meanwhile, Sarawak United People's Party (SUPP) Datuk Seri Dr Sim Kui Hian will be defending his Batu Kawah.  Nicholas Kudi Jantai Maseng has been named as the candidate for Baleh, a seat which was left vacant following the death of its incumbent Tan Sri James Masing Jemut,  the Parti Rakyat Sarawak (PRS) president. He is also Masing's nephew. The 12th Sarawak election will be held on Dec 18 while nomination will take place on Monday (Dec 6). In the last state election in 2016, GPS then known as Sarawak Barisan Nasional under the leadership of the late Adenan, secured a 72-seat majority in the oldest state assembly in Malaysia.  Following the defeat of the BN in the 14th general Election the four Sarawak-based component parties quit the colaition and formed GPS in 2018.  GPS was left with 68 seats after the Parti Sarawak Bersatu (PSB) decided they were no longer remain as 'GPS-friendly' following the resignation of its President Datuk Seri Wong Soon Koh from the state cabinet.  Out of the 68 seats, PBB controls 47 seats, PRS has 11 seats while SUPP has seven seats and PDP has three seats.", "entities": [{"id": 6719, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 0,

'In most circumstances, a 'red flag' is typically raised when a senior anti-graft official is suddenly brought into disrepute with accusations and claims.  'Naturally, questions will be asked on the motivation and timing of these allegations; are there more to it than meets the eye?' Fazli said in a statement today. RTBA Malaysia is part of an international advocacy group that protects businesses in the Asia-Pacific region from criminal conduct. 'In the case of Azam Baki, the nature of how the controversy had unfolded and the continued level of noise generated on this issue clearly warrants a deeper investigation beyond what is front and centre,' he said.  The Securities Commission of Malaysia today announced that it has concluded its enquiry into the said case and was unable to conclusively establish that a breach under section 25(4) of the Securities Industry (Central Depositories) Act 1991 (SICDA) has occurred. Fazli further clarified that RTBA Malaysia is not propagating conspiracy theories but urging all relevant parties connected to this issue, especially regulators and public service administration, to look at the issue more comprehensively and strategically given the nature of the position itself (as head of the anti-graft agency).   'The chief commissioner of MACC is not beyond the law, but he must also be subject to a fair hearing and not trial by media or constant public attacks that may impact the anti-graft agency from top to bottom,' Fazli said. 'As an organisation tasked to combat corruption, MACC must not be demoralised but instead become more vigilant in its effort to get to the bottom of this controversy while ensuring its ongoing investigations are not be sidelined,' he said.    'All in all, this crisis must be resolved quickly and comprehensively to safeguard the sanctity and reputation of MACC so as not to derail our war on graft,' Fazli concluded.", "entities": [{"id":

Chief statistician Datuk Sri Mohd Uzir Mahidin said the expansion of IPI was contributed by the increment of 8.4 per cent in the manufacturing index and 3.7 per cent in the electricity index but the mining index recorded a decline of 2.5 per cent. 'On a month-on-month basis, the IPI increased by 1.3 per cent driven by the manufacturing, mining and electricity indices,' he said in a statement today. He said the manufacturing sector output increased by 8.4 per cent year-on-year in December 2021 after recording a growth of 11.3 per cent in November 2021. 'The main subsectors that contributed to the growth in the manufacturing sector in December 2021 were electrical and electronics products (18.2 per cent), food, beverages and tobacco products (10.3 per cent) and non-metallic mineral products, basic metal and fabricated metal products (5.3 per cent),' he said. Simultaneously, he said the growth of the manufacturing sector was driven by both export-oriented industry (9.6 per cent) and domestic-oriented industry (5.7 per cent). 'The increase in export-oriented industries was mainly supported by the manufacture of computer, electronics and optical products and manufacture of vegetable and animal oils and fats,' he said. He said the performance of the manufacturing sector was also in line with the encouraging growth of exports. Meanwhile, he said the growth for the domestic-oriented industry was attributed to the manufacture of food products and basic metals. 'The manufacturing sector on month-on-month basis increased 0.5 per cent as compared to November 2021 supported by higher capacity utilisation especially in the electrical and electronic products and petroleum, chemical, rubber and plastic products subsectors,' he said. He said the decline of mining sector output in December 2021 as compared to the same period of the previous year was due to the 5.5 per cent decrease in crude oil and condensate index 0.2 per cent decrease in natural gas index. However, he said the mining index registered an increase of 4.1 per cent as compared to the previous month. He said the electricity sector output rose 3.7 per cent year-on-year in December 2021 while on the month-on-month comparison, the electricity index increased by 1.7 per cent. Mohd Uzir said the IPI for the fourth quarter 2021 grew 6.9 per cent as compared to the same period of the previous year with the increase attributed to the growth in the manufacturing index (9.2 per cent) and electricity index (4.3 per cent) while the mining index contracted 0.8 per cent. He said the IPI in 2021 recorded an expansion of 7.4 per cent as compared to 2020 influenced by the rise in all components including the manufacturing index (9.5 per cent), electricity index (2.3 per cent) and mining index (1.5 per cent). Mohd Uzir said compared to the period before the occurrence of Covid-19 in 2019, IPI grew 2.7 per cent and the manufacturing index increased by 6.6 per cent.

'The objective of the setting up of the military field hospital is to help the hospitals under the Ministry of Health (MOH) in treating Covid-19 patients after bed usage in the hospitals had surpassed 80 per cent of their capacity at that time.

In fact, he said MAF was always prepared to reopen the hospitals should the need arise, especially with the increase of cases involving the Omicron variant. 'So far, we have not received any instruction to reopen the field hospitals,' he said. The field ICU was set up using four military containers to house 12 beds, while 15 other beds were placed in four makeshift tents in the HKB parking lot.

'We have noticed there is a vast difference in the severity of the cases when compared to August 2021 when the numbers of reported cases were at 22,000 plus and almost every private hospital, particularly in the Klang Valley, had zero beds available both in their Covid-19 wards and Covid-19 ICUs (intensive care unit).

Cases have steadily risen from 15,000 to 20,000 yesterday and are expected to hit the 22,000 mark today. Omicron is not as deadly as the Delta variant and Dr Kuljit said despite Omicron being highly infectious, Malaysia isn't as badly affected with severe cases due to the high rate of vaccine and booster dose administration. He said continued adherence to SOPs coupled with self-monitoring should be the norm and he does not expect the healthcare facilities to be overwhelmed. 'As many countries are moving into endemicity, we should be preparing ourselves too towards that direction as we do not expect the healthcare facilities to be overwhelmed. 'Total private hospitals beds are estimated at 16,500 and there are various percentage of beds in each hospital made ready to help the government at any time assistance is required to receive decanted non-Covid-19 patients and treat full paying Covid-19 patients based on the capacity and capability of the individual private hospital,' he added.

Globally, the ARRs are being introduced to improve the integrity of financial benchmark rates as part of a transition to transaction-based rates, in line with the London Interbank Offered Rate reforms after the global financial crisis. The central bank said the ARRs aim to facilitate the usage of benchmark rates that are more robust and 'based upon transactions in active, liquid markets.' 'In Malaysia, the MYOR will run in parallel to the existing Kuala Lumpur Interbank Offered Rate (KLIBOR) with periodic reviews to ensure that the financial benchmark rates remain robust and reflective of an active underlying market,' it said in a statement today. 'This multiple-rate approach is supported by the Financial Stability Board and adopted by many other jurisdictions.' BNM said the availability of two financial benchmark rates provided market participants with the flexibility to choose the rate that best suits their needs and facilitates the development of MYOR-based products. The offering of MYOR-based products would provide a wider array of hedging instruments that would support additional risk management strategies, it added. In conjunction with the launch, BNM has published the MYOR Policy Document, which incorporates the key features and governance standards developed in collaboration with the Financial Markets Committee (FMC). It said the MYOR would be administered and calculated by the central bank as the volume-weighted average rate of unsecured overnight ringgit interbank transactions, including BNM's overnight monetary operations. 'The publication of MYOR for a given Kuala Lumpur business day will be at 10 am on the following business day on the bank's website. The bank will conduct periodic reviews of the MYOR to ensure it remains robust and representative of conditions in the underlying market,' it said. The publication of the two- and 12-month KLIBOR tenors, 'which are the least referenced rates in the market for financial contracts,' would be discontinued on Jan 1, 2023, the central bank said. It said the remaining one-, three- and six-month KLIBOR tenors, which continue to reflect an active underlying market, would be reviewed in the second half of 2022. 'The FMC will engage the International Swaps and Derivatives Association to ensure continuity of KLIBOR derivatives contracts in the event of a temporary or permanent discontinuation of KLIBOR publication,' it said. In other developments, BNM said a new Islamic benchmark rate would be developed to replace the Kuala Lumpur Islamic Reference Rate (KLIRR) by the first half of 2022.", "entities": [{"id": 6936, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 12}}, {"id": 6937, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 43}}, {"id": 6938, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 45, "end_offset": 48}}, {"id": 6939, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 148, "end_offset": 156}}, {"id": 6940, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 369, "end_offset": 392}}, {"id": 6941, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 554, "end_offset": 562}}, {"id": 6942, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 863, "end_offset": 888}}, {"id": 6943, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 931, "end_offset": 934}}, {"id": 6944, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1330, "end_offset": 1333}}, {"id": 6945, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1471, "end_offset": 1498}}, {"id": 6946, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1500, "end_offset": 1503}}, {"id": 6947, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1681, "end_offset": 1684}}, {"id": 6948, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1755, "end_offset": 1767}}, {"id": 6949, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 2364, "end_offset": 2367}}, {"id": 6950, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 2384, "end_offset": 2431}}, {"id": 6951, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 2598, "end_offset": 2601}}, {"id": 6952, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 610, "end_offset": 622}}], "relations": [{"id": 3358, "head": 6937, "tail": 6938, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 3359, "head": 6937, "tail": 6943, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 3360, "head": 6937, "tail": 6944, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 3361, "head": 6945, "tail": 6946, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 3362, "head": 6937, "tail": 6947, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 3363, "head": 6945, "tail": 6949, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 3364, "head": 6937, "tail": 6951, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 3365, "head": 6949, "tail": 6950, "relation": "partnership with", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 3366, "head": 6944, "tail": 6945, "relation": "partnership with", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 3367, "head": 6937, "tail": 6940, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 3368, "head": 6937, "tail": 6940, "relation": "significant event", "relation_source": "DocRED"}]}, {"id": "article_394", "text": "KOTA KINABALU: Sabah Progressive Party (SAPP) is glad that several issues for which it fought for almost three decades are taking shape now.

Among the key struggles of the party is the Sabah identity card for legitimate Malaysians in Sabah, the return of Labuan to Sabah and the just sharing of our oil and gas natural resources, all of which are consistent with compliance to MA63.'   The former chief minister also said the party, which is part of Perikatan Nasional, continues to pursue land reforms including the revival of 999-year land tenure, and the Residency System of decentralised government, as well as finding truths to the Double 6 tragedy in 1976.  He reminded SAPP members to be on a high level of situational awareness to understand the political intrigues happening around Sabah and at the federal level.   'Only when we have situational awareness, then we can have constructive engagements with other political parties who share a common purpose with SAPP.'  Yong also extended appreciation to members for their loyalty and dedication even though the party has very little access to political power at the moment.

Following the company's briefing last Friday, HLIB said this was despite Kimlun only achieving a mere RM20 million in the first half (1H) and little indications of more achieved since. It said some outstanding tenders were for hospital, infrastructure projects in Sarawak and private sector opportunities. 'Given the time constraint, we have imputed a RM250 million assumption in FY21 which could hinge on revival of private sector jobs on reopening. 'On the execution side, Kimlun has obtained approval from several clients to slow down construction progress in view of elevated material prices. 'This could slow down recognition verses expectations increasing downside risks to earnings forecasts,' it said in a note today. As for the Pan Borneo Highway Sarawak (PBH) project, HLIB said progress rate was relatively unchanged from April 2021, implying difficult construction conditions due to supply chain issues in addition to restrictions. 'The management has also indicated limited timeline visibility for PBH Phase 2 tenders. As such, Kimlun has tendered for other state infrastructure projects,' it said. Meanwhile, Kimlun's outstanding manufacturing orderbook stands at RM300 million. HLIB said orders for the 1H came in at RM75 million, versus its assumptions of RM200 million orders in FY21. 'In terms of contract opportunities, we do expect Kimlun to continue securing various project orders from Singapore and could also secure work from the upcoming RTS (Johor Baru-Singapore Rapid Transit System).

KPWKM in a statement today said its Minister Datuk Seri Rina Mohd Harun has ordered eight JKM Disaster Supplies Storage Depots (DSKB) to be on standby by ensuring that the basic disaster relief items and additional necessities are always sufficient. 'The minister has also reminded there should be no delay in helping the victims so as not to cause distress among the disaster victims,' read the statement. According to the statement Rina was at the JKM Central Zone DSKB in Sungai Buloh today to ensure the required preparations were in order. It added that JKM has been directed to make immediate procurement of additional supply of basic necessities to replenish supplies as most of the stock available at the Sungai Buloh DKSB had been used up during the recent flood disaster. According to KPWKM there are eight DSKBs in the country which are located in Kedah, Selangor, Johor, Pahang, Terengganu, Kelantan, Sarawak and Sabah, besides the 165 state disaster stores or mini depots as well as 521 forwarding base stores. It said KPWKM through JKM is prepared to open another 500 relief centres nationwide, in line with the need for more effective management of disaster victims. The ministry is also identifying the relief centres that could be used as a forwarding base to function as a store for the community to speed up the process of distributing aid to disaster victims. 'In this regard, another 200 new forwarding bases have been set up especially in Selangor and Johor,' read the statement. To date, 95 relief centres are still operating in six states across the country to shelter victims of floods and landslides, comprising 12,758 people from 3,830 families. KPWKM has also been appointed to lead the Social Rehabilitation Committee established under the Special Operations and Post-Flood Task Force to help rebuild morale and provide psychosocial support to

greater business cooperation between Malaysia and Vietnam to achieve US$18 billion (RM76 billion) bilateral trade by 2025. Matrade director of Asean and Oceania Raja Badrulnizam Raja Kamalzaman said despite struggling with the impact of the pandemic and trade dispute between the world's economic powerhouses, Vietnam managed to record a gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 2.9 per cent last year. 'It was one of the few countries that recorded positive growth amid the Covid-19 situation in 2020,' he said in a statement today. Vietnam, which has more than 96 million people of whom 65 per cent are aged 35 years old and below, is currently experiencing a growing middle-income group and with business-friendly policies in attracting investments in the industrial sector, making it a popular destination for trade and business in Asean. On November 23-25, 2021, Matrade led a group of 17 Malaysian companies to explore strategic business collaborations between Malaysia and local enterprises in the exciting and rapidly growing Vietnamese market, through the Virtual Export Acceleration Mission (EAM) to Vietnam. The mission featured companies in the machinery, parts and components, cosmetics and personal care products as well as food and beverages, aimed at tapping into the growing demand in Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, and surrounding provinces. 'These companies offer a wide range of industrial solutions such as data-driven smart solution platform and automation machinery, total beauty care products covering from tip-to-toe, varieties of prepared meals, and ready-to-drink beverages, among others. 'Apart from providing a platform for Malaysian companies to expand their brands' footprint in Vietnam, this EAM also hopes to open up opportunities for Vietnamese companies to explore partnerships amid uncertainty in the business environment due to the Covid-19 pandemic,' it said. Through this mission, 142 online one-to-one business meeting sessions were arranged with 46 Vietnamese companies, which generated total sales of RM62.67 million, it added. 'Major interests were recorded for plants' extracts derived from green biotechnology processes, feminine care, and skincare products as well as hair treatment solutions. 'Apart from the series of meetings, an online briefing session through a webinar was organised on Nov 23 in collaboration with the Investment and Trade Promotion Centre of Ho Chi Minh City (ITPC) and

BARU: Members of the General Operations Force's (GOF) famed Senoi Praaq team will be deployed to Orang Asli settlements in Gua Musang to help track down the tigers which have posed a threat to the villagers. GOF North Brigade deputy commander, Assistant Commissioner Mohd Noh Khamis said the special tracker team from the 3rd Battalion will be sent to Gua Musang next week. However, he said the exact number of GOF members involved in the operation has yet to be finalised. 'The team will work closely with rangers from the state Wildlife and National Parks Department (Perhilitan) in searching for the tigers,' he told New Straits Times. The Senoi Praaq are a unit made up almost entirely of Orang Asli members. Its history spans back to the days of the Malayan Emergency, when it first developed its reputation as an elite jungle warfare fighting force. It is learnt that the deployment of the Senoi Praaq GOF to Gua Musang was made following a request by the Gua Musang District Office a few days ago. The additional manpower is deemed necessary to aid the authorities to track down the tigers in the Orang Asli settlements, especially in Pos Bihai. It is also learnt that the Senoi Praaq team based in Pera was selected as they are proficient with the conditions around the forested areas in question. Tiger threats at several Orang Asli settlements in Gua Musang, especially in Pos Bihai and Pos Balar, started in early December, causing nearly 2,000 Orang Asli people to live in fear. The state Wildlife and National Parks Department has mounted a large-scale operation to track down the animals but to date, they have yet to capture the tigers. Deputy Menteri Besar Datuk Mohd Amar Nik Abdullah said the state government was informed by the state Wildlife and National Parks Department that there were four groups of tigers in the Orang Asli settlements in Gua Musang. Meanwhile, the situation in several Orang Asli villages in Gua Musang have fallen eerily quiet as villagers, especially children, remained indoors for safety reasons.", "entities": [{"id": 7079,

As a result, BAM have decided to send some of their junior shuttlers to the ongoing Slovenia International and Austrian Open next week.  While the national body have not set any specific targets for the juniors, they hope to see the juniors do well to boost their morale.  'We did not set any targets for them because realistically, they have not played in any international tournament for more than a year.  'It's very hard to keep players motivated if they do not play in tournaments.  'One of our objectives is to fast track these young players, and that is why we decided to send them to Europe. Bear in mind that there are also no junior tournaments right now.  'If they do well, it will boost their morale. At this moment in time, we can only plan things one step at a time,' said BAM Development Committee chairman Datuk Ng C  hin Chai.  Yesterday, the qualifying round of the Slovenia International got underway in Maribor.     In the mixed doubles, Goh Boon Zhe-Cheng Su Yin reached the main draw after clearing two qualifying round matches.  In the first match, the Malaysian pair saw off Austria's Michael Tomic-Karoline Pottendorfer 21-9, 21-12 before defeating Slovenia's Domen Lonzari-Marusa Vraar 21-18, 21-17.

508,911 in 2021 from 529,514 registered in 2020. Of this, passenger vehicles (PV) accounted for 452,663 units and commercial vehicles (CV) comprised 56,248 units, according to the latest data by the Malaysian Automotive Association (MAA). The MAA president Datuk Aishah Ahmad said the TIV fell for the second consecutive year. However, the 3.9 per cent contraction was much smaller than the 12.4 per cent contraction recorded in 2020. 'The contraction can be attributed to the measures and wisdom of our government in balancing between saving lives and jobs so as not to jeopardise the domestic economy,' Aishah said in a virtual press conference today. Nonetheless, she said it was still commendable given the tremendous challenges faced by the industry. 'In fact, it was slightly higher than the MAA forecast of 500,000 units, which we announced on July 22 last year,' she added. For December, the MAA said the TIV dropped 5.3 per cent year-on-year (YoY) to 65,184 units, from 68,854 units recorded in the same period in 2020. Majority of the sales volume were contributed by PV at 57,603 units, with CV accounting for 7,581 units sold in December 2021. Aishah said December was the highest monthly sales recorded in 2021. 'Companies ramped up deliveries of vehicles to fulfil backlog orders especially for companies with financial year ending December 2021.' She said companies' year-end promotional campaigns had also boosted sales for December. Meanwhile, production of new vehicles slipped 3.0 per cent YoY to 54,166 units in December from 55,860 units produced in December 2020. Total production of PV stood at 49,901 units, while CV made up 4,265 units during the month. For 2021, the total production of new vehicles eased 0.7 per cent to 481,651 units from 485,186 units produced in 2020. The MAA expects sales for January this year to be slightly lower than December 2021. This is attributable to shortage of chips which will affect certain makes, as well assupply disruption caused by floods in certain parts of Klang Valley and states in the east coast. However, sales may be driven by the Chinese New Year promotional campaigns.", "entities": [{"id": 7161, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 12}}, {"id": 7162, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 22}}, {"id": 7163, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 311, "end_offset": 343}}, {"id": 7164, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 345, "end_offset": 348}}, {"id": 7165, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 355, "end_offset": 358}}, {"id": 7166, "label": "ROLE", "position": {"start_offset": 359, "end_offset": 368}}, {"id": 7167, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 369, "end_offset": 387}}, {"id": 7168, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 717, "end_offset": 723}}, {"id": 7169, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 910, "end_offset": 913}}, {"id": 7170, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1012, "end_offset": 1015}}, {"id": 7171, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 1268, "end_offset": 1274}}, {"id": 7172, "label": "ORGANIZATION", "position": {"start_offset": 1915, "end_offset": 1918}}, {"id": 7173, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 2109, "end_offset": 2115}}, {"id": 7174, "label": "LOCATION", "position": {"start_offset": 2136, "end_offset": 2148}}, {"id": 7175, "label": "EVENT", "position": {"start_offset": 2215, "end_offset": 2231}}, {"id": 7176, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 359, "end_offset": 387}}, {"id": 7177, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 355, "end_offset": 387}}, {"id": 7178, "label": "TITLE", "position": {"start_offset": 369, "end_offset": 374}}, {"id": 7179, "label": "PERSON", "position": {"start_offset": 375, "end_offset": 387}}], "relations": [{"id": 3546, "head": 7163, "tail": 7164, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 3547, "head": 7163, "tail": 7165, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 3548, "head": 7179, "tail": 7178, "relation": "award received", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 3549, "head": 7179, "tail": 7166, "relation": "occupation", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 3550, "head": 7179, "tail": 7165, "relation": "Org-Aff.Membership", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 3551, "head": 7163, "tail": 7169, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 3552, "head": 7163, "tail": 7170, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 3553, "head": 7163, "tail": 7172, "relation": "NO_RELATION", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 3554, "head": 7173, "tail": 7174, "relation": "significant event", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 3555, "head": 7179, "tail": 7168, "relation": "given name", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 3556, "head": 7179, "tail": 7171, "relation": "given name", "relation_source": "DocRED"}, {"id": 3557, "head": 7161, "tail": 7162, "relation": "Part-Whole.Geo", "relation_source": "ACE05"}, {"id": 3558, "head": 7161, "tail": 7162, "relation": "location", "relation_source": "DocRED"}]}]
