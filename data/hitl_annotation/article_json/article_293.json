{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR: With only four Super League rounds to go, Johor Darul Ta'zim (JDT) are expected to retain their crown for the eighth straight time. JDT extended their lead at the top of the standings by eight points when they overcame Sabah 2-0 on Sunday. Benjamin Mora's side have 45 points, while Terengganu are second on 37. However, Mora does not want his team to take their remaining matches lightly. 'We have teams like Selangor, Terengganu and Kedah who have more matches left due to Covid-19 positive cases. They will fight until the end, so we need to maintain our form. We want the title more than ever,' he said on Sunday. Bergson da Silva scored a brace for JDT on Sunday to take his tally to 19 goals.  JDT will play PJ City FC at the MBPJ Stadium on Saturday. On the win over Sabah, Mora said his team controlled the entire match. 'My team kept on fighting for goals. We had Guilherme de Paula with Da Silva manning our attack, and they did well.' Sabah, on a six-match winless run, will face Penang on Saturday."}
