{"text": "IF  there ever is a perfect time for men's doubles Aaron Chia-Soh Wooi Yik to end their Open title wait, now is the time. Seeded second for  the German Open on March 8-13, the world No 7 are expected to face a bit of challenge from their Malaysian counterparts in the opening rounds. However, barring any upsets, Aaron-Wooi Yik will likely face world No 4 and reigning world champions Takuro Hoki-Yugo Kobayashi of Japan in the final. Fresh from winning the Badminton Asia Team Championships (BATC) this month, Aaron-Wooi Yik are aware that they must start winning Open titles, having reached a few finals in the last four years. 'This has been on my mind since I arrived here late last year, and I've informed Aaron-Wooi Yik as well.  'They know that it is high time for them to start thinking of ways to end their Open title wait,' said national doubles coaching director Rexy Mainaky yesterday. 'To be honest, Aaron-Wooi Yik have not had the best of preparations since the World Championships last year due to quarantine, festive breaks, and then the BATC, but we will try our best at the German Open. 'Winning an Open title will boost their confidence after coming close on so many occasions.' In 2018, the Tokyo Olympic bronze medallists reached the final of the SaarLorLux Open (now Hylo Open) in Germany before losing to England's Marcus Ellis-Chris Langridge.  A year later, they lost to Indonesia's Muhammad Ahsan-Hendra Setiawan in the All England final.  In 2020, Aaron-Wooi Yik reached their third Open final, but once again settled for second place, this time to Tokyo Olympic champions Lee Yang-Wang Chi Lin of Taiwan at the Super 1000 Thailand Open. Aaron-Wooi Yik will open their German Open campaign against Malaysian independent duo Goh V Shem-Low Juan Shen and are expected to face compatriots Goh Sze Fei-Nur Izzuddin Rumsani in the second round. Sze Fei-Izzuddin face compatriots Man Wei Chong-Tee Kai Wun in the first round. Aaron-Wooi Yik, the reigning Sea Games champions, will likely face world No 11 Ong Yew Sin-Teo Ee Yi in the quarter-finals. The 2020 Thailand Masters champions play India's M.R.Arjun-Dhruv Kapila in the first round. Tan Kian Meng-Tan Wee Kiong are the other Malaysians in the fray.  They are up against top seeds Hoki-Kobayashi in the opening stage."}
