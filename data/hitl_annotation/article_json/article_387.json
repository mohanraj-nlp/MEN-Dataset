{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR: The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) must continue the war on corruption and must carry out its duties and responsibilities despite the ongoing saga of its chief commissioner Tan Sri Azam Baki. Retail and Trade Brands Advocacy Malaysia Chapter (RTBA Malaysia) managing director Datuk Fazli Nordin said this is a time when the entire MACC organisation must rally together to protect and defend its institution while keeping a wary eye on those who may be trying to disrupt its job and question its integrity.  'In most circumstances, a 'red flag' is typically raised when a senior anti-graft official is suddenly brought into disrepute with accusations and claims.  'Naturally, questions will be asked on the motivation and timing of these allegations; are there more to it than meets the eye?' Fazli said in a statement today. RTBA Malaysia is part of an international advocacy group that protects businesses in the Asia-Pacific region from criminal conduct. 'In the case of Azam Baki, the nature of how the controversy had unfolded and the continued level of noise generated on this issue clearly warrants a deeper investigation beyond what is front and centre,' he said.  The Securities Commission of Malaysia today announced that it has concluded its enquiry into the said case and was unable to conclusively establish that a breach under section 25(4) of the Securities Industry (Central Depositories) Act 1991 (SICDA) has occurred. Fazli further clarified that RTBA Malaysia is not propagating conspiracy theories but urging all relevant parties connected to this issue, especially regulators and public service administration, to look at the issue more comprehensively and strategically given the nature of the position itself (as head of the anti-graft agency).   'The chief commissioner of MACC is not beyond the law, but he must also be subject to a fair hearing and not trial by media or constant public attacks that may impact the anti-graft agency from top to bottom,' Fazli said. 'As an organisation tasked to combat corruption, MACC must not be demoralised but instead become more vigilant in its effort to get to the bottom of this controversy while ensuring its ongoing investigations are not be sidelined,' he said.    'All in all, this crisis must be resolved quickly and comprehensively to safeguard the sanctity and reputation of MACC so as not to derail our war on graft,' Fazli concluded."}
