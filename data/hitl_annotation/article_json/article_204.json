{"text": "KOTA KINABALU: Sabah has set up a technical committee to negotiate for a bigger share of revenues from the oil and gas sector in the state. Sabah Chief Minister Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor said the committee chaired by state Local Government and Housing Minister Datuk Seri Masidi Manjun would soon sign the commercial cooperation agreement (CCA) with Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas). 'Through the CCA, Sabah will have greater revenue sharing as well as greater participation and say in our oil and gas matters,' said Hajiji during a briefing on the Malaysia Agreement 1963 (MA63) Special Council for Sabah's lawmakers at the State Legislative Assembly here today. Hajiji said before the briefing, he had discussed the matter with the Petronas president and group chief executive officer Datuk Tengku Muhammad Taufik. The special briefing was to provide insight and convey latest developments to elected representatives about the Sabah and Sarawak governments' demands that have been submitted to the federal government via the MA63 Special Council. The demands include the proposed bill to amend the federal constitution to be in line with the provisions of the MA63, which Sabah and Sarawak had persistently pursued. Hajiji and his Sarawak counterpart Tan Sri Abang Johari Openg had submitted the states' demands at the MA63 Special Council chaired by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob. 'The bill to amend the federal constitution is actually a product of the MA63 Special Council's decision that took into account requests from both Sabah and Sarawak. 'The Sabah government sees the formation of the MA63 Special Council as a crucial phase and a manifestation of the government-of-the-day's readiness to resolve issues that have been agreed before this,' he said. The briefing was also attended by Minister in the Prime Minister's Department (Sabah and Sarawak Affairs) Datuk Seri Dr Maximus Ongkili, Agriculture and Food Industries Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ronald Kiandee and Minister in the Prime Minister's Department (Parliament and Law) Datuk Seri Dr Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar. At the same event, Hajiji witnessed a ceremony in which the federal government submits a letter granting authority to the Sabah government to issue deep sea fishing licences. The letter granting authority was handed over by Kiandee to Sabah Agriculture and Fisheries Minister Datuk Seri Dr Jeffrey Kitingan."}
