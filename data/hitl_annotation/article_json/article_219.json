{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR: The Malaysian Trades Union Congress (MTUC) has urged the government to raise the minimum wage to RM1500 and the minimum monthly cost of living allowance (Cola) to RM300 for all workers next year. MTUC secretary-general Kamarul Baharin Mansor, in a statement today, stressed that the new minimum wage should be implemented in a uniform manner, in line with the government's 'Keluarga Malaysia' vision. 'MTUC demands the government implement a new minimum wage since the rising price of goods which has rendered the current minimum wage inadequate to sustain the livelihoods of workers. 'In accordance to the National Wage Consultative Council Act 2016 that requires the minimum wage to be revised every two years, MTUC believes the government must revise and raise the minimum wage, starting Jan 1, 2022. 'The minimum wage must be increased immediately to demonstrate that the government is concerned about the welfare of workers and wants to uplift them,' he said. Kamarul Baharin said, increasing the minimum wage of workers will also increase the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) savings of low-level workers that will improve their financial resilience post-retirement. MTUC, he said, also wanted the government to embark on a National Wage Transformation plan for the benefit all segments of workers in the country. 'At present, low-level workers only get pay raise if the minimum wage is increased while middle-level workers do not get any pay raise. 'The National Wage Transformation plan should include annual pay raise, salary scale for every job position, academic qualifications and etc. 'The minimum wage is one of the salary aspects that must be updated,' he said. Malaysia's minimum wage for workers was last raised from RM1,100 to RM1,200 in February 2020."}
