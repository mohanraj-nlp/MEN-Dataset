{"text": "PUTRAJAYA: Malaysians need to accept the possibility that there are already Omicron variant-fueled Covid-19 cases in the country, said Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin. He however said the public should not panic as preventive steps and standard operating procedures (SOP) in Malaysia are very stringent. The ministry, he said, is also increasing its genomic surveillance capacity to detect the variant of concern. 'If you look at countries that are imposing measures due to the emergence (of Omicron), they are doing what we are doing. 'We are among the countries that are extremely cautious. We still have quarantines, a mask mandate and very detailed contact tracing. In just one hour, we received all the info on the first Omicron variant case detected,' he said in a press conference today. He said all those who had come into contact with the country's first Omnicron patient - a 19-year-old South African student - were subsequently contacted by field officers based on their MySejahtera app check-ins and interviews. Khairy said the field officer who interviewed the student had verified that she had not breached her quarantine, and did not merely rely on checks on MySejahtera. 'What this incident tells us is that the system works and we can capture the variant through genomic tests. So, if everyone sticks to the rules and keep themselves updated on the transmissibility, spread and effects, we should be okay. 'But on whether community spread is inevitable or not we are still watching other countries. The UK and US are reporting an increasing number of cases but we have yet to see if it would take over the Delta variant.' Meanwhile, Khairy said that the SOP for the Sarawak state election is almost ready and that the ministry is finalising several aspects before sending it to the Election Commission. He said the discovery of the Omicron variant in Malaysia naturally meant that the election's SOP would be more stringent to prevent outbreaks during the polls. He said the ministry would also make an announcement on whether boosters would be the a prerequisite for one to be declared fully-vaccinated."}
