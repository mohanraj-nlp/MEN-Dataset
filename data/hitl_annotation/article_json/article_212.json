{"text": "BERA: Prices of essential goods are expected to stabilise and recover by early next year. This is when most countries reopen their borders, allowing economic activities to slowly return to normal, said Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob. He explained that the current price increase came about because borders at several countries were closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent movement control order. This prevented Malaysia from importing the essential items needed. Ismail Sabri adds a surge in demand but a drop in supply will also result in prices increasing. He said although the price increase was beyond the control of the government, it nevertheless, did not remain idle, nor did it claim that its hands were tied on the matter.  He added that the government has introduced various measures to alleviate the burden faced by the people following the hike in essential goods prices. 'The government will always look into ways to help the people by prioritising their interests as we do not want them to endure hardship or suffer. Ismail Sabri said the ongoing Keluarga Malaysia (Malaysian Family) sales programme is among the measures taken by the government to assist the people.   'Since vegetable farmers are experiencing an increase in pesticide price, the government has provided subsidies and incentives hoping that the vegetable prices will drop. 'The Keluarga Malaysia sales programme offers discounts up to 50 per cent and will be carried out for three months till March next year until the prices of goods stabilise,' he said. Ismail Sabri said this in his speech when opening the Bera parliamentary-level mass circumcision programme at the Bera District Council Hall here today.  A total of 350 children aged between five and 12 years old took part in the mass circumcision ceremony which was sponsored by Ismail Sabri's constituency office. On a separate matter, Ismail Sabri said the Rural Development Ministry has been given an additional RM500 million to intensify developments in rural areas nationwide. 'This is to ensure those living in rural areas will be provided with proper infrastructures including roads and housing projects', he said."}
