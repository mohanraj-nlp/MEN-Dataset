{"text": "KUALA BERANG: Ajil assemblyman Maliaman Kassim escaped being swept away by currents after a lorry he was in fell on its side in an incident at 5.30pm yesterday.  Maliaman who was delivering food aid to flood victims in Hulu Berang in a Civil Defence Force (APM) vehicle, only suffered minor injuries on his leg.  He was rescued later by a boat.  The lorry which landed on its side after it was swept by strong currents near Sungai Kampung Lebak here was also ferrying 13 other APM personnel.  In his Facebook page, he extended his gratitude to the rescuers who came to help.  'Allah has extended our life. I was with 13 APM personnel in a mission to deliver food aid to victims in Hulu Berang.  'Luck was not on our side when the APM's logistic vehicles was swept away near Sungai Kg Lebak.  'Food and clothing which were in the lorry could not be saved.  'I sincerely apologise for failing to deliver the item to the victims.  'Millions of thanks to the rescuers who saved us,' he said.  Continuous rain in the east coast region triggered floods at low lying areas in the state.  Thousands were evacuated to safety as the flood situation continued to worsen."}
