{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR: The government is confident in its ability to formulate a well-aligned federal budget with the needs of the rakyat and the country's policies and objectives, according to the Finance Ministry. This came after the inaugural publication of the Public Consultation Papers (PCPs) to complement the Pre-Budget Statement issued on August 31, 2021. MoF said PCPs could be an avenue for all stakeholders to provide feedback and contribute to formulating the 2022 Budget to improve the transparency and inclusivity of the nation's annual budget preparation process. Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz said PCPs were published to obtain inputs towards the 2022 Budget to ensure improvement of the government procurement policy on local and goods, services and procurement policy for the Bumiputera. 'This outlines proposals to improve the use of local goods and services and the affirmative policy for Bumiputera companies,' he said in a statement today. Tengku Zafrul said this is aimed at, among others, protecting and developing local industries as well as reducing dependency on imported goods. 2022 Budget would also focus on the recovery from the pandemic with the improvement of cash assistance programmes. The programme aims to identify the needs of the rakyat and current gaps and issues in delivering assistance, especially in light of the challenges posed by the pandemic. The PCPs would provide a review of the overall investment tax incentive framework to ensure that incentives for investors remain relevant in the current business landscape. 'The review is intended to enhance the country's overall competitiveness in attracting quality investments, which in turn would generate economic growth, support job creation and strengthen the country's fiscal position.' MoF said the PCPs also facilitate the government in drafting the Fiscal Responsibility Act to improve governance, transparency and accountability of the country's fiscal management. This includes the management of revenue, expenditure, debt and financial risks, and the publication of pre-budget and post-budget reports, economic forecasts and the Medium-Term Fiscal Framework."}
