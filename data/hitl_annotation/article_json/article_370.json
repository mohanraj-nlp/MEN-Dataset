{"text": "THERE is still no decision by BAM on the fate of the Malaysia Open.   The tournament, scheduled for May 25-30, faces the possibility of being called off due to the increasing number of  Covid-19 cases.   And with Malaysia imposing a 14-day quarantine for visitors, several foreign shuttlers are in the dark over their travel plans.   However, BAM president Tan Sri Norza Zakaria has not ruled out the Malaysia Open, and he said discussions are still underway with various parties.   'We are still in the midst of discussion with the Badminton World Federation and various agencies,' he said yesterday.    'I do know that things are getting more difficult but they are beyond our control.   'A lot of the discussion is centred around the standard operating procedures and the quarantine period for incoming athletes.    'We hope that we'll be allowed to have players coming in especially since this is an Olympic qualifying event. But we also have our rules and regulations and we'll still have to run it through with the National Security Council and the Sports Ministry.'   Adding complications to the Malaysia Open is the Movement Control Order (MCO) which will be implemented from today.   Meanwhile, BAM signed a one-year sponsorship worth RM5 million with BP Healthcare Group, and this will enable BAM shuttlers to have regular screenings for Covid-19 at BP Healthcare centres.   'The support from BP Healthcare is timely as we move into the final stages of our preparation for the Tokyo Olympics. 'We  are thankful for their pivotal contribution to Malaysian badminton,' said Norza."}
