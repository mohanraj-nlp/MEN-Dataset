{"text": "TERENGGANU Cycling Team (TSG) are hoping for better luck at the National Road  Championship which kicks off in Melaka today.   Last year, TSG were not so fortunate. Their rider, Nur Amirull Fakhruddin Mazuki, who was the defending champion, was pipped by Team Sapura Cycling's Akmal Hakim Zakaria by a mere bike's length and had to settle for second place in the elite road race in Bukit Katil.   This time, the Malaysian heavyweights will field a vastly experienced squad, comprising three-time Le Tour de Langkawi (LTdL) stage winner Harrif Saleh, his brother Zamri Saleh, LTdL red jersey winner Nur Aiman Zariff, Afiq Huznie Othman, Shahrul Mat Amin, Wan Abdul Rahman Hamdan, Amirull as well as the in-form Irwandie Lakasek who finished on the podium in two stages of the Tour of Thailand earlier this month.   TSG team lead coordinator Sharonjane Liau believes that her charges are well prepared.   'We want to win back the (road race) title. However, it will not be easy with strong teams such as Sapura and also SNC Cycling competing,' said Sharonjane yesterday.   'Last year, it was a tough race for us as we faced a number of technical issues which affected some of our riders, including Harrif.  'For the time trial (today), we will be banking on Aiman and Afiq.   'For the road race (Thursday), as the Bukit Katil course is quite undulating, it may not be that suitable for sprinters such as Harrif.   'So it is likely that he will be working for riders such as Aiman and Amirul who are better suited to this course.'   Kelantan-based SNC Cycling, who were formed last year, are the nation's newest continental team after TSG and Sapura."}
