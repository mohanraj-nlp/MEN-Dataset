{"text": "GEDONG: Voters in Sarawak have been urged to support Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS) to allow the continuity of the newly launched Post Covid-19 Development Strategy (PCDS) 2030 without any interruptions.  GPS chairman and caretaker chief minister Tan Sri Abang Johari Openg said the people of Sarawak need to play their part to ensure the continuity of the development strategy, and not allow it to be affected by any change in leadership.  'I hope the people will play their role for the future of Sarawak and their grandchildren,' he told a press conference after the Gedong state seat nomination process this morning.  Abang Johari will face Mohamad Sofian Fariz Sharbini from Parti Sarawak Bersatu (PSB), Kamal Bujang from Parti Amanah Negara (Amanah) and Tomson Ango from Parti Bumi Kenyalang (PBK) in the Sarawak state election.  This is the first time Abang Johari will be contesting in the Gedong state seat, after moving from the Satok state seat which he won for eight consecutive terms.  He was given the go-ahead by Datuk Naroden Majais, who had offered to make way for Abang Johari to stand in the rural seat. During the 11th Sarawak State Election in 2016, Naroden won the seat with a majority of 3,365 votes defeating Amanah candidate Rapelson Richard and Independent broker Uja Bansi.  Meanwhile, Abang Johari said he is confident voters will evaluate what has been implemented by the GPS-led government, and how the party had managed the state to date.  He said a new manifesto which is a continuation from the 2016 manifesto, will be announced on Wednesday.  'Although some people say the manifesto is not a bible, but for us it is an agreement that we should implement as best we can.  'So far, we have delivered what we had promised in 2016.'  On the nomination process, Abang Johari said he was made to understand that the process ran smoothly.  'This is proof that the democratic process in the state is alive.  'I would like to thank those involved in the nomination process, including the security forces and the Election Commission (EC).  'Also, the general public for adhering to the standard operating procedures (SOP) today.  'The campaigning period will begin after this and I hope all the candidates will follow the instructions from the EC and also the authorities with regard to the SOP,' he said."}
