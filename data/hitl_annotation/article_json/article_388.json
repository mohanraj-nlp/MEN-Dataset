{"text": "SHAH ALAM: A septuagenarian passed away while trapped at her flooded home in Section 19, here, early this morning.  Esah Hussin, 71, died at 7.55am today after being taken to the second floor of her home when floodwaters entered the ground floor of her double-storey terrace house.  Her daughter Khadijah Mohd Said, 49 said apart from her late mother, another seven individuals were also trapped in the house, including her 57-year-old husband, children and nephews who are between 8 and 24 years old.  'My mother can't walk and yesterday we tried to help her upstairs because water had entered the house. However, we could not do it as she was quite weak.  'This morning she wanted to go upstairs and we were helping her walk upstairs when she suddenly suffered from shortness of breath and had a stroke.  'I told her to recite (the syahadah) and took her to the bed to check her pulse. When we checked her blood pressure, the reading returned an error message while the oxygen reading was blank,' she said when contacted today.  Khadijah said her mother was suffering from heart disease and was unable to walk.  She said the family was waiting for a medical team to confirm the death of her mother.  'I was informed that the paramedics had arrived but they could not enter because the water was too high and could only be passed by pickup trucks.'  It is understood that the paramedic's location to the house was a mere one kilometre.  'I just want my mother's death to be confirmed and taken to the hospital afterwhich we can hold her funeral,' lamented Khadijah."}
