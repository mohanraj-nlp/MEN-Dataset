{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Yinson Holdings Bhd's net profit eased 3.0 per cent year-on-year (YoY) to RM98.00 million in the third quarter (Q3) ended October 31, 2021, from RM101.00 million recorded previously. In an exchange filing today, the energy infrastructure and technology company said this was mainly due to lower progress from engineering, procurement, construction, installation, and commissioning (EPCIC) business activities and net unfavourable foreign exchange movement of RM16 million. Its Q3 revenue plunged 63.7 per cent YoY to RM820.00 million from RM2.26 billion posted in the same period, dragged by lower progress in EPCIC business activities. For the first nine-month period, Yinson's net profit increased 35.5 per cent to RM336.00 million from RM248.00 million, while revenue decreased 20.3 per cent to RM2.87 billion from RM3.60 billion. Yinson said global energy demand is anticipated to rise, providing a positive outlook for the energy industry as a whole. 'While alternative energy sources, such as renewables, are forecasted to have the steepest growth curve in the global energy mix, the contribution of oil and gas (O&G) is anticipated to remain significant, even in the longer term.' Yinson is cognizant of the challenges faced by the industry, including the changing appetite of financial institutions towards the industry and climate change risk. 'We are confident that the company is well-positioned to ride the energy transition and manage the various risks presented. 'Together with recent project wins that boosts the group's orderbook up till 2048, and a strong team to support project management and operations.' The management is optimistic about its ability to stay resilient through challenges. 'Amid the challenging global economic environment and the volatility of other currencies against the US dollar, the group strives to achieve satisfactory results for the financial year ending January 31, 2022.'"}
