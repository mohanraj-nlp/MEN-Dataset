{"text": "Vietnam's remarkable rise to the top of Asian football is still very much in the ascendancy after they took another step closer to advancing to the final round of the World Cup qualifiers by edging Malaysia 2-1 on Friday. Que Ngoc Hai struck a late penalty winner after Guilherme de Paula had cancelled out Nguyen Tien Linh's opener from a spot-kick as well. Vietnam coach Park Hang Seo was a relieved man after the final whistle. The Golden Dragons will top the group and guarantee a spot in the final round of the qualifiers if they avoid defeat against the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday.Skip 'This was a tiring game. We still have another crucial game coming up, and a good result will see us advance to the next stage,' he said on Friday. 'I am here to make Vietnamese fans happy, and it will be an honour if I can help the team create history here. 'Against Malaysia, I was thinking of playing 3-4-3 or 3-5-2 but opted for the latter. It proved to be the right decision. 'I would like to thank the players. They fought resiliently to achieve this result.' Vietnam had to reshuffle their lineup in the absence of regulars Nguyen Quang Hai and Nguyen Tuan Anh through suspension and injury, respectively. However, their replacements, Luong Xuan Truong and Nguyen Hoang Duc, were exceptional in the match. With 17 points in the bag, Vietnam are almost assured of a place in the third round even if they finish second in the group."}
