The facility is part of the client's Sarawak Expansion Project, and it will be located at Sama Jaya Free Industrial Zone in Kuching. The project is expected to commence in mid-September 2021 and be complete by December 2022. The contract win pumped up KGB's new orders secured to date in 2021 to approximately RM764 million, up 56 per cent from RM490 million contract wins in the full year 2020. 'As with every one of our projects, we will steadfastly deliver excellence to the client backed by our teams' extensive technical know-how and vast experience in building a state-of-the-art facility. 'We hope to strengthen our relationship with this client and continue to play a part in its expansion in Malaysia. This landmark project will open further opportunities for us and propel KGB to greater growth in the electronic industry,' chief executive officer Raymond Gan said in a statement today. He said the operating landscape across the company's business segments is improving, and tender invites are rising especially in Singapore and Malaysia, after a pause earlier this year due to the lockdown measures. 'We are cherry-picking projects that enable us to strike a balance in terms of scale and profitability to optimise our capacity better. 'Our focus is to broaden the clientele and project portfolio to ensure we deliver sustainable growth that creates value to both our stakeholders and shareholders,' he said. The company will accelerate efforts in executing its enlarged outstanding orderbook of about RM902 million promptly."}
