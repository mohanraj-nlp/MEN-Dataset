{"text": "KUCHING: Pakatan Harapan (PH), including DAP has never failed to bring their race-religion incitement politics from Peninsular Malaysia to Sarawak, claimed Parti Pesaka Bumiputera Bersatu (PBB) Senior Vice-President Datuk Seri Fadillah Yusof.  He said their propaganda in the 12th Sarawak election was to accuse the Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS) as undermining the multi-cultural, multi-religious harmony in the state by being in the federal government with Barisan Nasional (BN) and Pas.  He said the opposition's propaganda completely ignores the stellar track record that GPS has in maintaining racial-religious harmony in Sarawak for decades that  Sarawak is widely acknowledged to be the most harmonious and tolerant territory in Malaysia.  'How can GPS be accused of collaborating with Pas when the Islamist party is contesting against GPS in this election?  'The reason GPS decided to work with the federal government is to ensure political stability in the country and to safeguard Sarawak's rights and development - which PH and DAP had failed to do when they were in power for 22 months,' he said in a statement today.  He said PH and DAP should be reminded that they were partners with Pas in the previous Sarawak election.  Fadillah, who is also the Senior Works Minister, said the recent Timah whisky controversy was also started by DAP's partner, Parti Amanah Negara, and further instigated by a PKR parliamentarian who claimed that drinking Timah whisky was like 'drinking a Malay woman' in Parliament.  'Where was DAP's voice then? I am confident that Sarawakians have become tired and can see through the same old racial religious instigation tactics that PH and DAP bring from the peninsula in every Sarawak election,' he said.  He urged the people in Sarawak to reject DAP in the upcoming state polls.  Fadillah, who is also Petra Jaya Member of Parliament (MP) said Sarawakians would never forget how the PH government had sought to delay the development of the Pan Borneo Highway including canceling the second phase of the highway, three bridges and the denial of the budgeted RM1 billion funds to repair schools in Sarawak.  He said the PH and DAP failed to deliver their promise of 20 per cent of oil royalty to be returned to Sarawak which forced the GPS government to impose state sales tax on petroleum products.  He said GPS' involvement in the federal government had safeguarded harmony and religious tolerance in Sarawak.  Citing the recent alcohol sales ban and restriction, which will not be imposed in Sarawak, he said this shows that the GPS government's policy on religious tolerance had been consistent from the time of the state's previous chief ministers.  'GPS trusts that the people will not be influenced by the tactic of casting doubt and aspersion on the government's stance, but will continue to stand firm to protect racial and religious unity in Sarawak,' he added."}
