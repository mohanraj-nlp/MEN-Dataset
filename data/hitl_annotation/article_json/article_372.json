{"text": "THE overlapping dates of the Thomas Cup and Vietnam Sea Games in May could see BA of Malaysia (BAM) coaching director Rexy Mainaky making changes to the doubles lineup for the men's teams. The Indonesian hinted that he may call up independent pair Ong Yew Sin-Teo Ee Yi for the Thomas Cup with world No 45 Man Wei Chong-Tee Kai Wun likely to be given a chance at the Sea Games. Wei Chong-Kai Wun were part of Malaysia's Badminton Asia Team Championships (BATC) winning team.  World No 11 Yew Sin-Ee Yi were not picked for the biennial event, which concluded in Shah Alam on Sunday. 'We have been discussing that (Thomas Cup squad), and we already have plans,' said Rexy. 'We cannot forget Yew Sin-Ee Yi because we also have the Sea Games going on at the same time. 'They will be under consideration because we have to strengthen our team. 'We will give a chance to Wei Chong-Kai Wun to prove (themselves) at the Sea Games, which have team and individual categories. 'They will likely be facing the same players that competed here (BATC).  The young Indonesian players competing here will also likely play in the Sea Games.' The Thomas Cup will be held in Bangkok on May 8-15, while the Vietnam Sea Games will run from May 12-23. Despite their misfiring performances at the BATC, Rexy added that he was still happy with the determination shown by national No 1 pair Aaron Chia-Soh Wooi Yik. The Olympic bronze medallists and world no 7 laboured to three-set wins against their South Korean and Indonesian counterparts in the semi-final and final of the BATC. 'They struggled, but I am proud that they were still able to overcome their difficulties in two important matches (semi-final and final) and win, despite not being at their very best,' said Rexy. 'We will analyse their game and determine what steps to take next to improve their performance.' Malaysia last won the Thomas Cup in 1992 in Kuala Lumpur ."}
