{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Mah Sing Group Bhd proposes the government introduce additional initiatives in the upcoming Budget 2022 that will help accelerate the recovery of the property industry in Malaysia. Founder and group managing director Tan Sri Leong Hoy Kum said the government should offer more measures targeting first-time homebuyers, specifically in-home financing, to boost homeownership. 'This includes reinstating maximum loan tenure to 40 years and setting the higher margin of financing up to 100 per cent for first property to help the M40 and B40 groups who are affected during the pandemic,' Leong said in a statement. The company also hopes the government can consider implementing the developer interest bearing scheme (DIBS) for first-time home buyers. He said this would allow buyers to have the option to not service their loan interest and rentals at the same time during the construction period. 'Additionally, we proposed the government to grant the extension of Home Ownership Campaign (HOC) for another year, as the campaign has been proven to be vital in helping home buyers to secure their home while reducing the housing overhang situation since it was launched,' he said. Meanwhile, Leong said the government should consider terminating the real property gains tax (RPGT) on properties sold after five years as an impetus to boost the secondary market. He said the re-imposition of RPGT on properties sold five years after the duration would possibly dampen the secondary residential property segment recovery and discourage long-term investment. 'This will also indirectly improve the home buyers' sentiment in property purchase,' he said. Besides, Leong also proposes that the government reduce the minimum threshold for foreign property ownership to RM600,000, although the current minimum threshold for foreign property ownership varies according to state. 'We hope the government can review and standardise the minimum threshold to RM600,000 across all states, especially in the areas with high property overhang such as the Klang Valley, Johor and Penang. 'With the current currency rate, it will attract foreigners to invest in tangible investments, which will help reduce the property overhang,' he said. On the Malaysia My Second Home Programme's (MM2H) programme, Leong has made several proposals to the government, such as lowering the qualifying minimum income, liquid assets, and fixed deposits instead of a drastic increase currently. Other recommendations are to impose different classes of applications, tailor the program for various foreign applicants, all existing MM2H pass holders should not be affected by the new rules, and the duration of the MM2H pass shall remain at 10 years. Other items on the wish list are reducing the compliance cost to lower house prices to benefit home buyers and introducing incentives for developments incorporating green features. The 2022 Budget is expected to be tabled in Parliament on October 29, 2021."}
