{"text": "SEMPORNA: Sabah Umno is ready to consider fielding a candidate for the Bugaya state seat if a by-election is to be held in near future. Its chief Datuk Seri Bung Moktar Radin said a decision would take into account the people's views and support in the constituency. 'In the last state election, we (Barisan Nasional) did not field a candidate to contest in this constituency, it was represented by (Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia) Daud Tampokon. 'However, he lost to Warisan who was represented by Manis Muka Mohd Darah in a six-cornered fight,' he said during a meeting with the Semporna Umno division here.  The last Sabah election was held on Sept 26, 2020. The Bugaya seat was left vacant after Manis Muka, 65, died of kidney failure on Nov 17, 2020. However, the by-election was postponed due to the outbreak of Covid-19 and a state of emergency was declared by the government.  According to Bung Moktar, there is a possibility the Election Commission will call for the by-election in the near future as the spread of the virus is now under control in the country. Bung Moktar who is also Sabah Barisan Nasional (BN) chairman, said the defeat of BN candidate Datuk Abd Razak Tun Sakaran in the 14th general election in Bugaya would not discourage them from fielding a candidate. 'We understand the influence of Parti Warisan Sabah president Datuk Shafie Apdal is still strong, but the people's acceptance towards BN is increasing as proven during the recent Melaka state election,' he said. Bung Moktar said Umno had 180 branches in Bugaya and the chances of winning would be high if all of its members were to give full support to the BN candidate. 'It is important for the Umno division leaders to reach out to the grassroots and all the Women, Youth and Puteri wings must be mobilised.'"}
