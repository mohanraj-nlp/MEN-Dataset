They cited, among others, the suitability of the vaccines used and the need for precautionary measures. Mother of four Rita Ngu, 37, said she was willing to let her children to be inoculated upon the availability of the vaccines. 'Some schools were already distributing consent forms as to inform the parents their children would be vaccinated,' she said when contacted today. Another parent, Dominic Hii, said he would take additional precautions by having his children increase their intake of Vitamin C and water. 'Eventually, everyone needs to be vaccinated in order to curb the spread of Covid-19,' said the father of three. Joyce Chieng, 34, said while it would be beneficial for her children to be vaccinated, she believed her kids were too young to be inoculated for the time being. 'I worry about my kids. For me, it is too young for a 5-year-old to receive the Covid-19 vaccination. unlike older kids, like 12-year-olds, who may be able to endure the side effects. 'Different people react differently to the vaccines. There are not specific measures to be prepared for any eventuality.' Chieng said if her children needed to be vaccinated, she would monitor their conditions closely. 'I will bring them to the hospital immediately if they are not well.'"}
