{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR: As the world faces the pandemic and is aiming for recovery, the business and public sectors must be extra vigilant and not resort to corruption. The Japanese Chamber of Trade and Industry Malaysia (JACTIM) Chief Coordination Officer Kazuya Kitae said anti-corruption efforts like the International Anti-Corruption Day was crucial to spread awareness on corruption prevention initiatives during these critical times. 'Malaysia did a good job in hosting this programme and spread this idea nationwide. We must not allow misconduct and that is why the International Anti-Corruption Day celebration is important in today's session,' he said at the International Anti-Corruption Day 2021 dialogue session organised by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) at the Wisma Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers. The session began with a presentation of an Overview of Anti-Corruption Efforts in Malaysia which included anti-corruption initiatives, laws and policies.    Among them are guidelines on gifting, enforcement of the corporate liability provision Section 17A of the MACC Act, the Organisation Anti-Corruption Plan (OACP), the Corruption-Free Pledge (IBR), asset declaration, procurement portal and the corruption offenders 'name and shame' database. The presentation was conducted by MACC Deputy Director of Community Education Mohamad Tarmize Abd Manaf followed by a dialogue session with business expatriates representing countries such as the United States, European Union (EU), China, Canada, United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, India, Indonesia and Taipei. Several MACC top officials participated in the dialogue session, namely Deputy Chief Commissioner (Prevention) Datuk Seri Norazlan Mohd Razali, Director of Anti-Money Laundering Division Zamri Zainul Abidin and Director of Inspection and Consultancy Division Nazli Rasyid Hj Sulong. The programme, jointly organised by the MACC and the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Foundation (YARM), also received the cooperation of three strategic partners this year, namely the Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM), Transparency International Malaysia (TI-M) and the Association of Certified Integrity Officers Malaysia (ACeIO). The programme was also conducted simultaneously by the MACC State Offices physically and virtually between the MACC and international corporate leaders involving various industry sectors in selected locations. Davita Malaysia head of compliance Sumita Menon said the explanation of the implementation of Corporate Liability in Section 17A of the MACC Act 2009 was very important especially on the interpretation of certain words in the act.    Sumita, who is also a member of the American Malaysian Chamber of Commerce (AMCHAM), said the dialogue session was very fruitful as the MACC officials were approachable, responsive, and clear in giving clarifications that allowed for better understanding. 'The session explained to me who the senior management was and who will be liable in cases of an alleged corruption and how the MACC investigates the matter. 'Besides that, the panelists also explained how an individual is charged and to what extent the company will be liable or impacted,' she said, adding that the information was crucial for her as the head of compliance in her company. Echoing her praises for the MACC, Taipei Investors' Association in Malaysia president Lim Kai Min said he was pleased to know that the MACC was listening to the voices of expats and willing to assist them with their problems.    'We would like more information and sources about the policies and services that the MACC can provide. We have an internal auditing team in the company to audit the standard operating procedures and we would like to put more anti-corruption effort on this,' he said."}
