{"text": "JOHOR BARU: The Parent-Teachers Associations (PTAs) of two secondary schools here are urging the Election Commission (EC) to reconsider the decision to use the premises as polling centres in next month's state election. SMK Impian Emas PTA president Mazlan Sulor said since the election would clash with the Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia examinations, parents are worried it would affect the candidates. 'Parents are worried that if the schools are used as polling centres, the risk of Covid-19 infection would increase. 'This is because there would a lot of outsiders, like election workers, party representatives and voters, who would congregate at the schools. We don't know where they are from so we are worried they might spread the virus,' said Mazlan. Shamsudin Baharon, the vice president of the PTA at SMK Aminuddin Baki, said the association has submitted a memorandum last Wednesday to the Johor EC asking them to reconsider the decision. 'We are voicing the parents' concerns considering the current rise in Covid-19 cases in the country. We do not want the risk of the students being infected while sitting for the examination. 'We hope that the EC would find a win-win solution in this matter and hope that all secondary schools are exempted from being used in the election,' said Shamsudin. Recently, the Education Ministry said it does not want the EC to use secondary schools as polling centres in the state election as it could interrupt the SPM examination. It's minister Datuk Dr Radzi Jidin said he will formally write to the EC on the matter soon. However, yesterday, Radzi said the ministry was informed that 151 secondary schools in Johor will be used for the election."}
