{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR: A total of 19 SmartTAG and hybrid SmartTAG-Touch 'n Go lanes will be operational in 16 key toll plazas along the North-South Expressway (NSE) by Jan 25. Plus Malaysia Bhd strategic stakeholder engagement head Syed Mohammed Idid said this follows complaints on traffic crawls and SmartTAG users' grievances on being caught off guard. He said that the move would cater to the lanes that were removed to expedite the rollout of the RFID on the NSE from Juru to Skudai as part of the second pilot on the system's implementation by the operator. 'Subsequently, on Feb 19, post Chinese New Year, an additional 18 more toll plazas will convert 24 lanes to SmartTAG lanes.' In a statement, the highway operator also said that it had committed teams to work round-the-clock on the ground to optimise the system's performance and sharpen the detection of RFID at all toll plazas.  'Quicker 'double arm' lane barriers will also be deployed at plazas with high traffic to ensure traffic will be able to be managed and cleared quickly. Additionally, to assist our highway customers, visual RFID detection zones will be painted on the lanes to ensure customers are able to position their vehicle to ensure optimum detection. 'On-the-ground personnel would also be deployed, where customer service assistants (CSAs) will be at all 158 RFID lanes across 74 toll plazas to assist customers who are stuck at the lanes using portable detection devices.  'Strategic fitment centres for RFID tag fitment and replacement are also available.' So far there are 24 fitment centres (FC) established on Plus highways and 35 at locations outside Plus highways.  'The full list of FCs can be obtained and updated from time to time at https://rfidregister.touchngo.com.my/fitment-centres. Customers experiencing detection issues at Plus highways will receive a Touch 'n Go coupon from our CSA and can proceed to the nearest fitment centre and Touch 'n Go will replace the tag for free if found faulty.  'Plus will continue to work with Touch 'n Go to increase the number of RFID fitment centres to ensure proper tag fitting by a professional fitment agent is available to customers,' Plus said. For detailed information on the location of the Touch 'n Go RFID tag installation, highway customers can visit the Touch 'n Go portal at http://www.touchngo.com.my or the Plus official website, www.plus.com.my and social media platforms including Twitter PLUSTrafik, Plus Malaysia Facebook as well as the Plus App.  The highway operator earlier apologised to all highway users for the inconvenience caused in the wake of traffic snarls caused by the removal of SmartTAG lanes and faulty RFID tags. Earlier Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob said road users must be given the option of using either the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) system, Touch 'n Go card, or SmartTAG at toll gates. He said this was decided by the Cabinet, which in its meeting yesterday, was of the view that road users must be given a choice, just like how it was practiced when Touch 'n Go was introduced in its early years and cash payments were still allowed to continue. Under the Works Ministry's Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) blueprint to drive down congestion on highways, the Multi-Lane Free Flow (MLFF) or gateless or boothless toll collection systems were slated to be implemented fully by 2026 via the RFID mechanism.  Ismail Sabri said the RFID, which was introduced to speed up travelling time, was a good suggestion but motorists must also be given an option since the RFID was a pioneer project and would need time to be fine-tuned."}
