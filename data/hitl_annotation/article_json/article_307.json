{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd's (BIMB) net profit eased 0.6 per cent to RM101.63 million in the third quarter (Q3) ended September 30, 2021, from RM102.25 million recorded in the same quarter last year. In a filing to Bursa Malaysia today, the bank said the lower net profit recorded for the quarter was due to a decrease in total revenue and an increase in total overheads. Revenue in the same quarter decreased 14.8 per cent to RM746.22 million from RM876.09 million. BIMB said gross fund-based income decreased by RM33.7 million or 4.8 per cent due to the downward revision of the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) in 2020. Non-fund based income also decreased by RM96.2 million for Q3 2021 compared to Q3 2020, mainly due to lower investment income, notably lower net gain from the sale of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income. Meanwhile, it said for Q3 2021, the banking group recorded a net allowance charged for impairment on financing and advances of RM34.0 million compared to RM155.5 million in Q3 2020. 'The lower allowance for impairment on financing and advances was mainly due to modest deterioration of assets quality as a result of various efforts from the banking group to assist customers during these challenging times such as Pemulih Repayment Assistance, targeted relief as well as giving out automatic moratorium to the affected customers,' it said. For the cumulative nine-month period, BIMB's net profit increased 17.3 per cent to RM454.67 million from RM387.74 million due to lower net allowance for impairment on financing and advances. Revenue in the same period eased 8.9 per cent to RM2.35 billion from RM2.58 billion. BIMB said with the current challenging economic landscape expected for the remaining of the year, banks are expected to continuously assess the situation, albeit to remain positive following further opening up of the economy. Meanwhile,BIMB has declared an interim single tier dividend in respect of the financial year ending December 31, 2021 of 10.93 sen per ordinary share amounting to approximately RM226.89 million."}
