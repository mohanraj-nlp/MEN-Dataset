{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Johor Darul Ta'zim (JDT) owner Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim has pledged to help Safawi Rasid regain his former self ahead of the Super League resumption next month. The forward was recently criticised for his performances when he was on international duty with Harimau Malaya for the World Cup qualifiers in Dubai. Safawi had sustained an injury in a Super League match against UiTM FC on March 13. And as a result, he did not feature in the next five matches for JDT. Safawi was not the only JDT player who was criticised during the World Cup qualifiers.  Mohamadou Sumareh, Liridon Krasniqi and Guilherme de Paula all received the same treatment from the fans, who were expecting more from them. Tunku Ismail said despite his injury, Safawi still scored goals for JDT and Harimau Malaya. 'After returning from a loan stint with Portimonense SC in Portugal in December, he made an immediate impact for JDT. 'In the first game of the season, he scored a goal in the 2-0 win over Kedah in the Charity Shield. 'He was not 100 per cent when he joined the national team.  'Now, we have to repair him just like how we need to fix other players who treated the call-up like a holiday,' said Tunku Ismail. In Dubai, Safawi scored from a spot-kick to help Malaysia record a 1-0 win over Thailand. Malaysia finished third in Group G of the qualifiers behind the United Arab Emirates and Vietnam."}
