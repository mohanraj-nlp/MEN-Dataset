{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 3  The headline IHS Markit Malaysia Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), a composite single-figure indicatorof manufacturing performance, rose to 52.8 in December 2021 from 52.3 in November, indicating a stronger improvement in thehealth of the sector. As a result, the average performance overthe final quarter was the strongest quarterly performance sincethe survey began in 2012, IHS Markit said in a research note today. Looking at the historical relationship between the PMI and official statistics, it said the latest reading is representative of a solid expansion in manufacturing production and gross domestic product (GDP), as the survey pointed to a broad recovery from the impact of Covid-19. \"December data suggested that output rose for the third month running. The pace of expansion was moderate and was thequickest since April. Firms commonly attributed the rise to stronger demand as pandemic restrictions were eased.New order volumes also increased at the end of the year, with the rate of growth reaching an eight-month high. \"Firms notedthat stronger client confidence had boosted demand in both domestic and external markets. Concurrently, new exportsales returned to expansion territory in December, as stronger demand in the US and China contributed to a fractional rise innew business from abroad,\" it said. IHS Markiteconomist Usamah Bhatti said the further easing of Covid-19 restrictions alleviated pressures faced by the Malaysian manufacturing sector and provided momentum to growth in December. \"Theaverage reading of the headline PMI in the fourth quarter was the strongest quarterly performance recorded sincethe survey began in July 2012, as output and new ordergrowth reached eight-month highs, respectively. 'Operatingconditions remain tough nonetheless, with supply chain delays, as well as material labour shortages widely reported across the sector,\" he said. Encouragingly, he said business expectations for the coming yearremained strong overall as a fifth of companies reported optimism that the worst of the pandemic had passed. \"Thatsaid, the degree of optimism eased from November as theoutlook remained relatively clouded due to uncertaintyregarding the duration of supply chain disruptions, rawmaterial shortages and further disruption caused by newvariants of Covid-19,\" he said."}
