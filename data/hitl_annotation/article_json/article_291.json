{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 27  Bursa Malaysia rebounded to end marginally higher due to bargain-hunting activities during the final hour of trading, said an analyst. At 5pm, the benchmark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI (FBM KLCI) gained 0.02 per cent or 0.23 of-a-point to 1,515.99 from 1,515.76 at yesterday's close.

Total turnover declined to 2.22 billion units valued at RM1.77 billion versus yesterday's 2.36 billion units worth RM1.84 billion. Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd vice-president of equity research Thong Pak Leng said key regional indices meanwhile closed mostly lower as investors weighed the likelihood that the US Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in March. Elsewhere, geopolitical tension surrounding Russia exerted additional downside pressure on equity markets globally.
