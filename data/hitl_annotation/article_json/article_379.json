{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR: The country's oldest association for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) said the hike in electricity tariff surcharge for non-domestic users from next month until June this year will hamper the industry's recovery from the economic impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. Small and Medium Enterprises Association of Malaysia (Samenta) chairman, Datuk William Ng cautioned that if the proposed surcharge continued as planned, it will be difficult, if not impossible, for businesses to absorb it without passing it partially to consumers. 'While we have and will continue to urge our members to refrain from raising prices despite this steep hike in electricity bills and costs of raw materials, we must also understand that most SMEs are already operating on a razor thin margin and struggling to find their footing amidst the pandemic,' he said in a statement today. He was referring to the electricity tariff surcharge of 3.7 sen per kilowatt hour (kWh) for non-domestic users for the February until June 2022 period as announced by the Energy Commission yesterday. Based on the Energy Commission and Tenaga Nasional Bhd's (TNB) own numbers, Ng said more than 1.6 million commercial and industrial users will be paying between 11.8 to 18.4 percent more for electricity from Feb 1. 'For most SMEs, especially those in the manufacturing sector, electricity is the second or third largest cost factor, behind raw materials and labour costs.  'A hike of up 18.4 percent in utility bill for a business that's running at sub-10 percent margin could mean a reduction of between 20 to 40 in its profits, and could even mean a difference between making and losing money,' he said. Although Samenta understands the need for periodic adjustments in prices, Ng said the association, however, could not accept the quantum or the timing of the imposition of the surcharge. Ng said this is especially so since TNB reported a 9.6 percent and 4.6 percent jump in revenue and earnings respectively for the nine months ending Sept 30 last year. He also cited a media report which quoted TNB president and chief executive officer Datuk Ir Baharin Din saying that demand is expected to improve in the coming months and into this year as more economic activities open for business. 'As such by TNB's own admission, the national utility company will be doing better in coming months. 'And there are no reason for the steep hike, especially since it is aspiring to cut down its reliance on coal in its portfolio from 45 percent in 2021 to 10 percent by 2035, with the costs of coal stock chiefly blamed for the steep hike,' Ng said. Therefore, Samenta, said Ng, has urged Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob to keep his promise by intervening in the issue and rescue ailing SMEs. If the hike must be allowed, Samenta urge the Cabinet to consider a far lower quantum of increment without affecting TNB's continued profitability or it's 'resilient performance'."}
