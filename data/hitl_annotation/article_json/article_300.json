{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Sime Darby Bhd has launched future-focused plans for its motors division with the establishment of a mobility special task force. The company said the task force was established to explore new trends and opportunities for growth in the automotive sector, particularly in shared mobility and the industry's electrification. 'As part of this mobility strategy, Sime Darby has invested RM42 million to date in mobility players,' it said in a statement. Group chief executive officer Datuk Jeffri Salim Davidson said the company acknowledges the evolution in the industry and is taking dynamic steps to future-proof its motors business. 'We have developed a mobility strategy as part of our efforts to revolutionise and transform our Motors division to be ready for the future of automotive. 'Our thrust into mobility is our Engine Two to Sime Darby Motors' Engine One, which we are continuing to fortify to its full potential,' said Jeffri. Engine One refers to the company's existing motors business which it is strengthening, while Engine Two relates to its future-focused strategies to capitalise on new mobility trends. Sime Darby is well-positioned to be the strategic partner for new mobility players offering a turnkey solution for all mobility needs through a wide range of fleet management services and across the electric vehicle (EV) ecosystem. With EVs transforming the automotive landscape, Sime Darby aims to capitalise on its many strengths along the value chain to become the leading EV specialist in the region. Sime Darby's recent investment of RM42 million in car-sharing company SOCAR and online used car platform CARRO demonstrates its ambitions to expand mobility. 'These investments are critical in growing our business beyond the traditional dealerships and in embracing alternative ownership models, as well as to capitalise on the solid growth potential in the car-sharing industry in the region. 'Our investments in these start-ups are strategic and symbiotic, and they come after we have spent the last year or two in collaboration on several fronts to see how we can leverage on each other's strengths,' said Jeffri. Meanwhile, group chief strategy officer Datuk Thomas Leong said as one of the leading automotive players in the Asia Pacific region, the company is taking on a more active and dynamic role in the transformation of the mobility industry. 'We remain on the lookout for more exciting investments and collaborative opportunities with other strategic partners to help us 'see ahead' into the future,' said Leong. Sime Darby Motors is the automotive arm of Sime Darby, with operations across nine markets in the Asia Pacific region. Sime Darby Motors is actively invested across the entire value chain of the automotive business, from assembly, importation, distribution and retail to after-sales services and rental."}
