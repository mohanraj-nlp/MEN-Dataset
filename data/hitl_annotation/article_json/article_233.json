{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 2  The government will organise the #Keluarga Malaysia (#Malaysian Family) sales programme simultaneously in all 222 parliamentary constituencies from this Saturday in an effort to ease the people's burden following the increase in prices of goods. Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob said for a start, the programme which offers daily necessities at between 20 and 50 per cent cheaper, would focus on B40 and M40 residential areas. 'At the initial stage, (it will involve) two areas in every constituency with B40 and M40 residents because the groups are the most affected especially post-Covid-19 pandemic,' he told a press conference after launching the programme at Lembah Pantai's Library Square here today. The one-day programme is a joint effort by various quarters including the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP); Agriculture and Food Industries Ministry and private companies. Ismail Sabri said the organisation of the #Keluarga Malaysia sales programme was expected to be held until February next year, depending on the current situation of prices of goods. The prime minister said the government's effort through several ministries responsible for importing supplies such as vegetables could ensure sufficient supply in the market and subsequently lower the selling price. 'If the prices of goods decline before February, the (#Keluarga Malaysia) sales programme will discontinue, but if prices do not go down, the programme will go on. The important thing is that the government is aware of what the people are going through and will not let them bear the burden alone,' he said. On today's programme, Ismail Sabri thanked 25 retail industry players for selling various daily necessities at cheap prices, thus helping the government reduce the people's burden. In the meantime, the prime minister said the National Action Council on Cost of Living would meet to discuss the causes of the rising prices of goods and determine the short- and long-term intervention methods. He added that besides KPDNHEP, the meeting would also involve the Housing and Local Government Ministry and the Transport Ministry. 'Transportation is often said to be the cause of price hikes. For example, using changing of tyres as an excuse. We don't change tyres every month and we don't want this to be an issue. That is why we also include the Transport Ministry,' he explained. Ismail Sabri also stressed that there should be no compromise in the form of action against any unethical traders who increase prices without reasonable excuse."}
