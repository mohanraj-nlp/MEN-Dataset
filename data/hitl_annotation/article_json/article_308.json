'This accomplishment added a boost to MSM group having achieved a turnaround in 2021 and accelerating MSM's expansion to wider markets across the region,' he said. Syed Feizal said MSM would provide sustainable raw sugar supply for Coca-Cola domestic market as part of the company's commitment towards environmental, social and governance framework. MSM said the company had been serving Coca-Cola domestically for more than ten years. The two-year contract with Coca-Cola Bottlers (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd allows MSM to supply refined sugar between 2022 and 2023. The contract also applied for the export that commenced in December 2021, where the refined sugar supply would be shipped to a different international destination where Coca-Cola has a strong presence. MSM Prai operates the Prai sugar refinery in Penang. Located on the northwest coast of Peninsular Malaysia, the facility is the country's largest sugar refinery, with an annual production capacity of 1.05 million tonnes of refined sugar. Meanwhile, MSM Sugar Refinery (Johor) Sdn Bhd, is strategically located at Tanjung Langsat Port, Johor, with an annual production capacity of one million tonnes of refined sugar, is set to ramp up its production in 2022. MSM group observes strict quality control and standard operating procedures, and its refineries are regularly audited to maintain the highest standard of food safety and quality.
