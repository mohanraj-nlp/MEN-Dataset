{"text": "AT age 8, Ahmad Hadif Khairol Zaki is   aware of the plight of flood victims. As such, he decided to  join a flood relief mission in Hulu Langat last Sunday. His mother, Aniza Hidayu Mohd Pilos, 34, from Kampung Laksamana, Batu Caves, here, said it was her eldest child's first time volunteering in such a mission. She said Hadif wanted to join the mission out of his own desire to help.  'My son has been spending a lot of time watching television during this school break.  So, I suggested that  he  become a flood-relief volunteer.  'I showed him some photos of his  friends who also joined  the flood relief activity  to encourage him to take part as well. He then got  interested in it,' she said  on Wednesday. Aniza Hidayu said  coincidentally, her brother, Al-Ahnaf Rabbani Mohd Pilos, 25, was  a volunteer with the Selangor chapter of  non-governmental  organisation  Khidmat Malaysia, and this motivated her son to join the mission. To prepare Hadif on what to expect, she explained to him about the situation in the flood-stricken area. She said her son enjoyed being a volunteer. She added that Hadif  did not complain  about feeling tired after returning home from the mission. 'As a mother, I am very happy with what he did because I wanted him to learn  the meaning of hardship. 'I always advise him  to be grateful for what he has. His participation in the relief mission will help him to realise this.' She said Hadif liked to lend a helping hand, especially during weddings. On the pictures of  Hadif volunteering that went viral recently, she said: 'The photos were taken   in flood-hit Sungai Serai, Hulu Langat. 'I hope that by sharing my son's experience, it will have a positive effect on how other children view  volunteerism.'"}
