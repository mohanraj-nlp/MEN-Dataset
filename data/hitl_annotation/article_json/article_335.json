{"text": "KOTA BARU: The state Wildlife and National Parks Department believes that several tigers spotted roaming in Pos Bihai, Gua Musang, recently may be infected with the canine distemper virus (CDV).  Its director Mohamad Hafid Rohani said the department's rangers were tracking down the tigers so they could be sent to the National Wildlife Rescue Centre (NWRC) in Perak.  'Based on our observation and from the sample of the tiger faeces taken, we suspect that the tigers might not be well, suffering from health problems or most probably infected by CDV as the result from the sample taken was positive.    'This might cause the tigers to move within the 10 km radius in Pos Bihai,' he said.  Hafid said the department, however, could not confirm whether the virus had infected the three tigers being hunted by the department's rangers or other tigers.  'We believe the Gua Musang tiger case to be similar to the one in Terengganu last year.  'The virus will cause the animal to be confused and go against its predatory instincts.  'This may be the reason why it does not harm humans and livestock that come into its path and only takes food from garbage,' he added.  He also said the department had yet to confirm whether the tiger that mauled an Orang Asli man in Gua Musang recently was among the three tigers which were sighted in Pos Bihai and Pos Balar recently.  'Although the tiger that attacked the Orang Asli was shot dead, we believe there are still a few roaming in the two settlements of late,' he added.  Last week, a 59-year-old Orang Asli man, Anek Along, was mauled to death by a tiger at Kampung Sau near Pos Bihai, Gua Musang."}
