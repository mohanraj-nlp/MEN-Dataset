{"text": "AARHUS: Almost two decades of heartbreak finally ended on Sunday for Indonesia as they captured the Thomas Cup, overcoming defending champions China 3-0 in the final at the Ceres Arena. This was Indonesia's 20th appearance in a Thomas Cup final and a record-extending 14th crown.  They achieved their last win in 2002 in Guanzhou when they defeated Malaysia 3-2. World No 5 Anthony Sinisuka Ginting survived a tense opening match to outlast world No 27 Lu Guang Zu 18-21, 21-14, 21-16 in 77 minutes to give Indonesia the lead. Guang Zu had replaced top-ranked Shi Yu Qi, who suffered an injury in the semi-finals against Japan on Saturday. 'Today's match against Guang Zu was the toughest in three meetings. However, I knew he would be pressing hard for a win, but I was calm throughout the match,' Anthony told Bernama on Sunday. Seventh-ranked Fajar Alfian-Muhammad Rian Ardianto showed their class in the next match, beating He Ji Ting-Zhou Hao Dong 21-12, 21-19 to double Indonesia's lead in front of 2,000 spectators. Indonesia clinched their winning point when World No 7 Jonatan Christie defeated 65th-ranked Li Shifeng 21-14, 18-21, 21-14.  'Winning the Thomas Cup is my biggest achievement, bigger than my Asian Games gold medal,' Jonatan told the Badminton World Federation.  Although veteran Hendra Setiawan did not play in the final, it was a meaningful outing for the Indonesian captain, who had never won the Thomas Cup throughout his illustrious career. However, the celebration on stage was a subdued affair for Indonesia as there was no hoisting of their red and white flag despite the national anthem being played. It is because of a sanctioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency for being non-compliant with the anti-doping code.  The Indonesian Badminton Association (PBSI) flag was instead raised during the victory ceremony"}
