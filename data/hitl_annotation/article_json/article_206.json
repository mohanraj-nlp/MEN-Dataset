{"text": "Cambodia are easy meat for Malaysia in their AFF Cup opener on Dec 6 at Singapore's Bishan Stadium?   Not as easy as Malaysian fans would think, according to national coach Tan Cheng Hoe.    He has analysed the Southeast Asian minnows, and concluded that they will offer strong resistance to Harimau Malaya in Group B.   Cheng Hoe was impressed with the Angkor Warriors who defeated Guam 3-1 on aggregate in an Asian Cup qualifier last month.   'Cambodia are playing well under coach Ryu Hirose with the guidance of team manager Keisuke Honda. They are improving fast as a team, so it will not be so easy for us,' said Cheng Hoe.    The experience of Japanese Honda, who featured in three World Cups (2010, 2014 and 2018), has helped Cambodia make inroads in the game.    'I do not want our players to be overconfident in the opening AFF Cup match.  'They have to focus on playing to instructions.     'They have several top players who ply their trade abroad. Chan Vathanaka, who had played in the M-League, is still in the game, and he is good.   'We have to be careful against Cambodia. They are hardworking and do a lot of running during matches, and they do not give up easily,' said Cheng Hoe.   After Cambodia, Harimau Malaya will take on Laos on Dec 9, followed by Vietnam (Dec 12) and Indonesia (Dec 19).   On Tuesday, 11 players reported for national training at Wisma FAM. The others will come in later due to the ongoing Malaysia Cup competition.   Cheng Hoe will only get his full squad of 28 players on Dec 1, a day after the Malaysia Cup final."}
