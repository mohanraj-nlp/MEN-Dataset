{"text": "JOHOR BARU: Umno and Barisan Nasional (BN) have yet to make any final decision on the party and coalition's candidates for the upcoming Johor state election. Umno secretary-general Datuk Seri Ahmad Maslan said candidates from BN for the upcoming election will be decided soon.  'So far, Umno and BN are still in the process of picking their candidates and have yet to make a final decision on the candidates (to be nominated) for the 56 state assembly seats in the polls. 'We will decide later. It includes whether candidates from Friends of BN will be fielded or not,' he said. He said this at a press conference after holding a meeting with the Malaysia Makkal Sakti Supreme leadership and the party's Johor division heads, here, today. Also present were Malaysian Makkal Sakti Party president, Datuk Seri RS Thanenthiran and Johor State Makkal Sakti chairman, Datuk Seri DR Suriya. Meanwhile, Ahmad, who is also the Pontian Member of Parliament said Umno and BN appreciated the undivided support from Makkal Sakti which remained loyal to the party and coalition during good and bad times. 'We were moved when Makkal Sakti pledged to mobilise the (party) machinery to help Umno and BN campaigns in the Johor election. 'Makkal Sakti has 27,000 members with 16 divisions in Johor and this is an asset to BN especially in campaigning for the Indian (votes) in the state,' he said. Meanwhile, Ahmad said the two Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu) who departed from the Perikatan Nasional component party have not applied to join Umno. 'Not yet, they (two-state assemblymen) have not submitted applications to join Umno,' he said. Yesterday, Larkin assemblyman Datuk Mohd Izhar, who is also the Johor Investment, Entrepreneur Development, Cooperatives and Human Resources Committee chairman, announced his departure from Bersatu with immediate effect. Last Thursday, Tebrau Bersatu division chief, Mazlan Bujang resigned as division chief and announced his withdrawal from the party also with immediate effect. However, Mazlan, who is also the Puteri Wangsa state assemblyman and former Bersatu Johor chairman has not joined any party so far but has since backed the BN government. Ahmad thanked the two-state assemblymen who expressed their support for BN and the Mentri Besar, Datuk Hasni Mohammad. 'I would like to state that no reward was offered or promised to the two-state assemblymen. 'They made the decision voluntarily, in good faith and without being promised anything because they are confident in the BN-led government. 'Thank you for their support and confidence, it means a lot to Umno and BN,' he said."}
