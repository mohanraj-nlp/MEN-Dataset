{"text": "NIBONG TEBAL: 10 schools located within a 10km radius of the Pulau Burung landfill, which was on fire last Wednesday, have been ordered to close temporarily from tomorrow until Friday.  The 10 schools are SJK (T) Ladang Byram, SJK (C) Pai Teik, SMK Seri Nibong, SJK (T) Nibong Tebal, SK Seri Sentosa, SK Keledang Jaya, SJK (T) Ladang Changkat, SMK Methodist, SK Methodist and SK Nibong Tebal.  Southern district education (PPDS) chief officer Mohamad Dziauddin Mat Saad said the decision was made after the district disaster management meeting yesterday.  He said the decision was taken as the air index in schools within a 10km radius was at AEGL 3 (Acute Exposure Guidelines Level), where the air affects the health and threatens the lives of residents.  'As a result, we have given permission to the 10 affected schools to be closed from Jan 19 to Jan 21.  'The southern district education office will inform no later than this Saturday on the status of the re-opening of the 10 schools based on the decision and advice from the Seberang Prai Selatan district disaster committee,' he said today.  Mohamad Dziauddin said during the closure of physical classes, students would resume with online lessons.  'The schools are required to inform the teachers and parents about the online classes.  'In addition, the schools are also required to inform the canteen operators, bus operators and other relevant parties for initial preparatory action.  'The schools are also required to provide staff tomorrow morning to manage students if they are present as a result of not being told about the school closure,' he added.  During the period, he stressed, school children should also wear face masks, reduce outdoor activities and to seek treatment at nearby clinics and hospitals if there are unwell.  It was reported that some 400 people from 86 families in Ladang Byram and Kampung Kebun Baru have been ordered to evacuate following air pollution brought about by the fire that gutted some 6.4ha (16 acres) of the 16ha (40 acres) landfill.  Yesterday, state Department of Environment (DoE) director Sharifah Zakiah Syed Sahab said the air quality, within a seven-kilometre radius from the landfill which was taken on Monday, was still polluted and dangerous."}
