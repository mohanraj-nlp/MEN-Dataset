{"text": "Malaysia will send their best possible squad for the Asia Team Championships on Feb 15-20 in Shah Alam.   With the issue of world No 7 Lee Zii Jia gradually being resolved, there is hope for Malaysia to mount a strong challenge in the competition at the Setia City Convention Centre.   All-England champion Zii Jia was slapped with a two-year suspension for wanting to leave the Badminton Association of Malaysia to turn professional.  BAM have however softened their stance after the Kedahan submitted an appeal letter.   An official decision is yet to be made but it is believed that Zii Jia will be let off with just a fine.    The 23-year-old has also pledged that he will be committed to the national team for the Asian meet which also serves as a qualifier for the Thomas and Uber Cup Finals.  The top four teams from the Asian team meet will automatically qualify for the Thomas and Uber Cup Finals in Bangkok this year.   'We are in the process of finalising the team although we have until tomorrow to submit the final list of names,' said BAM secretary-general Datuk Kenny Goh.   'Whatever it is, we will definitely put our best team out there as it is the best that we can do.   'I've discussed with our two coaching directors - Wong Choong Hann and Rexy Mainaky and we will definitely be open to professional players as we want to look at the team as a whole.   'Realistically, we want to qualify on merit as well although we will also weigh what the team need tactically before deciding on whether to introduce new faces,' added Kenny.   A total of 10 teams have signed up for the Asian meet although traditional powerhouse China have not entered the competition.   The 10 countries are Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, India, Thailand, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Kazakhstan.  'China have not entered as they are taking a very careful approach in regard to the Covid-19 situation,' said Badminton Asia chief operating officer Saw Chit Boon.   'I believe the Selangor state government has done a good job and all standard operating procedures will be met.'"}
