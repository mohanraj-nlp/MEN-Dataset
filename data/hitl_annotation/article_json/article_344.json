{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Pharmaniaga Bhd's subsidiary, Pharmaniaga Research Centre Sdn Bhd, is partnering with the National Institutes of Biotechnology Malaysia (NIBM) to expand research and development (R&D) capabilities to produce locally made vaccines. Today, both entities have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU). The collaboration was proposed to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob at the launching ceremony of the National Vaccine Development Roadmap and Malaysian Genome and Vaccine Institute. The MoU was signed by Pharmaniaga group managing director Datuk Zulkarnain Md Eusope and NIBM acting chief executive officer and Agro-Biotechnology Institute Malaysia director Dr Seetha Jaganathan King.  Zulkarnain said the R&D cooperation between both parties would spur further pertinent efforts in the pharmaceutical industry to help the government protect the national interest by having locally developed and produced vaccines to fulfil the rakyat's needs. 'Malaysia has been relying on the importation of vaccines as currently no human vaccines are being developed and produced locally.  'The closest is the fill and finish manufacturing of Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine by our wholly-owned subsidiary Pharmaniaga LifeScience Sdn Bhd (PLS),' he said. Zulkarnain said Pharmaniaga would cooperate with NIBM in many areas of R&D and training on vaccines, allowing Malaysia to develop and produce various types of vaccines for babies, children and adults in the near future. 'We are confident with the outcome of this cooperation as PLS has more than 300 professional, scientific workforce, and it has developed more than 240 generic drugs which we later manufacture on our own for the local and international markets. 'Indeed, this cooperation will also be another step towards building national readiness against any pandemic in the future, as well strengthen Pharmaniaga's plan to establish world's first halal vaccine manufacturing plant in Malaysia,' he said. Pharmaniaga is the product registration holder and sole distributor of the Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine in Malaysia. To date, Pharmaniaga has supplied 20.4 million doses of the vaccine to the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.  At its high-tech EU certified plant, PLS can manufacture four million doses of fill and finish Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine a month and currently supplies the vaccine needs of the private market."}
