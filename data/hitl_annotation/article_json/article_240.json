{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia's fiscal deficit is predicted to reduce to 6.5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2022, down from 7.0 per cent in 2021, UOB Global Economics and Markets Research said. This is mostly because Malaysia would have transitioned from a pandemic to an endemic phase, and the domestic economy would have recovered to achieve 5.5 per cent growth in the following year, according to the report. The government is expected to set a higher GDP growth target for 2022, aiming for 5 to 6 per cent growth, up from 3 to 4 per cent in 2021. UOB senior economist Julia Goh said pending the passage of a higher debt ceiling at 65 per cent to fund an additional RM45 billion Covid-19 expenditure, the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to remain below the new threshold at 63 per cent in 2022. 'The government is anticipated to enact the Fiscal Responsibility Act next year, broaden the revenue base, introduce Public Service Act, and new Public-Private Partnership (PPP) blueprint to attain long-term fiscal sustainability,' she said in a note. Meanwhile, Goh said the research house expects the government to announce expansionary policies in the 2022 Budget. 'We expect expansionary policies which include RM32.5 billion for the Covid-19 Fund, development expenditure of RM76.1 billion (including rehabilitation plan), continued targeted cash handouts and financial aid particularly for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). 'These initiatives will be aligned with the 12th Malaysia Plan (12MP, 2021-2025) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) that sets the medium-to-long term path for the country,' she said. On financing, Julia said the firm expects the government to issue new sovereign bonds and utilities other reserves to fund its expansionary budget next year. 'This is given higher global interest rates and anticipated monetary policy normalisation in major economies, amid caution on bond supply pressures. 'Total gross Malaysian Government Securities (MGS) and Government Investment Issues issuance (GII) is estimated to maintain at 2021's level at RM160-RM165 billion in 2022, going by our 6.5 per cent budget deficit-to-GDP ratio target,' she added."}
