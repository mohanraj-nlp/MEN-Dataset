The ICPS would be issued at an issue price of three sen each, Minetech said in a statement today. Minetech's major shareholders Datuk Awang Daud Awang Putera, Choy Sen@Chin Kim Sang and Chin Leong Choy have collectively provided their undertakings to subscribe 256.2 million ICPS. The company said the rights issue was part of its series of corporate exercises and on the basis of one ICPS for every two existing shares held by entitled shareholders. In the abridged prospectus issued on September 23 by the company's principal advisor TA Securities Holdings Bhd, Minetech said any unsubscribed ICPS would be made available for excess applications by entitled shareholders and/or their renouncees or transferees. The undertakings by Awang Daud and the other major shareholders is expected to generate at least RM7.69 million. 'Having evaluated various fund-raising methods, Minetech's board of directors shared that it deemed the right issues of ICPS exercise, alongside private placement of new Minetech shares to be the most appropriate avenue for it to raise the required funds. 'As the recent Covid-19 pandemic and resulting business interruptions have an adverse effect on a global economic scale in the immediate and long term, Minetech views its ability to raise funds expeditiously as crucial to finance our operations by providing more flexibility and financial buffer in terms of cash flow management,' it said. Awang Daud, who is Minetech executive chairman, said the rights issue would assist the company in improving its financial performance in the next financial year. 'At the same time, it will help raise capital for our diversifications into renewable energy and expansion of the construction segment, which are viable businesses that continue to see growing demand. We believe both industries can potentially contribute 25 per cent or more to our net profit,' he added."}
