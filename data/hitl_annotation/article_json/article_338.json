{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR: How low can Malaysia go? Or how Laos can Malaysia go?   Sadly, quite low at the Asean Football Federation (AFF) Under-23 championships if today's performance  is anything to go by.    Malaysia lost 2-1 to underdogs Laos in their Group B match at the Prince Stadium in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.    Yes, Malaysia got defeated  by minnows Laos. This is not a typo.    Brad Maloney's boys never expected this ending, especially after  Malaysia took a 1-0 lead though A. Selvan who fired past Laos goalkeeper Keo Oudone Souvannasangso just before half-time.   But Laos showed Malaysia what fighting spirit is all about as they hit back with the equaliser in the 56th minute. Laos captain Bounphachan Bounkong broke past the Malaysia defence to deliver a clinical finish.    Yet, Laos were not content with the equaliser. They pressed on, and in the  79th minute, were rewarded with the winning goal. Defender Phoutthavong took a shot and it went in.    On the eve of the match, the media reported that Laos had a wily German coach in Michael Weiss. And Weiss certainly didn't waste time in proving himself at the expense of Malaysia."}
