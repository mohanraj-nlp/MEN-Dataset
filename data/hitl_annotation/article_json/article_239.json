{"text": "Datuk Razlan Razali will leave it to the fans to decide whether they will consider Sepang Racing Team (SRT) a Malaysian team or not when the MotoGP outfit take on a new identity next season. Razlan, who is the team principal, and racing director Johan Stigefelt are set to take over the team from Sepang International Circuit (SIC). While many team members will be retained, the new setup will drop the names of SIC and Petronas after both parties decided to end their partnership with SRT recently. 'I will leave it up to the fans. There has always been a debate about it since SRT joined MotoGP. 'Fans believe that if you have a Malaysian team, you need to have Malaysian riders. How many Malaysian-owned (foreign) football teams have Malaysian players? 'At the end of the day, MotoGP, just like football, is also a sport. Even before the days of SRT, Malaysians were already supporting Valentino Rossi and Ducati. 'At least for next year, there will be a Malaysian ownership in MotoGP. If Malaysians are not proud of that, then it is up to them. 'I am proud to be the only Malaysian in history to be a team principal in MotoGP. I am still surviving despite the challenges. 'Many expected the team to fold up after the decision by Petronas to pull out as sponsors. I will make sure the team continue as this is what I love.' SRT were criticised by fans this season for not having Malaysian riders in their MotoGP, Moto2 and Moto3 teams."}
