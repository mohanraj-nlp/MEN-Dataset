{"text": "THE Professional Footballers Association of Malaysia (PFAM) have hit out at Kelantan FC owner Norizam Tukiman over his alleged unprofessional behaviour in disclosing a 'sensitive matter' on social media.   Norizam, known for his fiery words on social media, has spoken out against five former Kelantan players following a pay dispute.    Recently, Norizam revealed the salary arrears (individually) of Kelantan's former players, Nazrin Nawi, Farisham Ismail, Nik Akif Syahiran Nik Mat, Shahrul Nizam Ros Hasni and Masaki Watanabe, in a Facebook post.  The total amount owing to the five players is RM158,857 for the month of November, 2020.   This has resulted in PFAM,  headed by Kuala Lumpur City striker Safee Sali, issuing a statement against Norizam, better known as Zamsaham, yesterday.   The players' association said they had expected Norizam to handle the issue professionally as the two parties were still at a correspondence stage.    PFAM said they, on their part, had also advised the five players to respect the due process by not making statements publicly about the case.   '(However) this issue was revealed by the (Kelantan) team themselves, and which has caused negative perceptions among netizens in social media.   'The matter should have been handled  (by Norizam) by replying to the claimant notice (from PFAM) officially. If no agreement was reached, both parties have agreed to extend the matter to the FAM status committee.'   PFAM said The Red Warriors' (TRW)  reason for not making full salary payments for November, 2020 was not  justifiable in the team not honouring their responsibilities in a contract between team and player.   'Among the matters brought up by Norizam was questioning the full payment of salaries if there were  injuries, discipline problems and red card.   'PFAM have no issue with this if the pay cuts follow what is permitted and done according to the terms of the contracts.   'But if they do not follow the terms of the contracts, PFAM think TRW  shouldn't implement the pay cut.'"}
