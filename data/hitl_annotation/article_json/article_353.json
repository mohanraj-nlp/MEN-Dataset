{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR: The Malaysian Aviation Commission (Mavcom) has approved 27 out of 28 air traffic rights (ATRs) applications submitted by airlines for the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2021. In a statement today, the commission said this represented an increase of 33.3 per cent in applications and a 28.6 per cent increase in approvals compared to the third quarter (Q3) of 2021. Of the 28 ATR applications, 17 were for domestic routes, which have more than doubled compared to the seven applications submitted in Q3 of 2021. Malaysia Airlines Bhd and World Cargo Airline Sdn Bhd received the highest number of approvals with six ATRs each, while AirAsia Group Bhd received an allocation of five ATRs and M Jets International Sdn Bhd was awarded three ATR allocations. Additionally, AirAsia X Bhd, FlyFirefly Sdn Bhd and Malindo Airways Sdn Bhd received two ATR allocations each, whereas MyJet Express Airlines Sdn Bhd was awarded one ATR allocation. Mavcom said the increase was primarily due to the reopening of interstate borders in October 2021 and a rise in demand for domestic holiday-related travel, with the additional flights mainly to Langkawi followed by Johor Bahru, Penang, and Kota Bharu.  Executive chairman Datuk Seri Saripuddin Kasim said Mavcom is seeing encouraging signs of recovery within the domestic segment, despite the ongoing pandemic. 'This promising development illustrates the sector's resilience and its ability to bounce back post-pandemic. 'We hope this continues as air travellers are highly encouraged to pre-plan their flights for festive periods well in advance to avoid crowds and high-ticket prices,' he said. Mavcom also received 13 ATR applications from the air cargo segment, signalling continued and sustained growth. The increase in ATR approvals was attributed to new cargo Air Service Licence (ASL) holders, namely World Cargo Airline and M Jets International, which received 9 ATRs from the commission in Q4 of 2021. Mavcom expected the new cargo segment to grow by between 3.9 per cent and 6.7 per cent year-on-year in 2022, translating to between 20.8 and 21.6 billion in freight tonne-kilometres (FTK)."}
