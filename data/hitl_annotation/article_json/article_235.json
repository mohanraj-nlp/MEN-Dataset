{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR: UMW Holdings Bhd ended 2021 with solid automotive sales of 262,685 vehicles despite subsidiary UMW Toyota Motor Sdn Bhd and associate company Perusahaan Otomobil Kedua Sdn Bhd (Perodua) having mixed performance. UMW Toyota surpassed its 2021 sales target of 62,000 units with a total delivery of 72,394 units, 22.0 per cent more than the 59,320 units registered in 2020. Perodua's sales slipped 13.6 per cent to 190,291 units from 220,154 units in 2020. UMW Toyota saw higher sales in December to 9,289 units in December 2021, up 9.4 per cent than the 8,487 units sold in November 2021, despite the challenges brought about by the flooding last month. As a result, UMW Toyota regained the leadership of the non-national segment. The solid performance was mainly contributed by the introduction of new models as well as the sales tax exemption. Toyota Vios continues to be the best-selling model with 31 per cent of its total sales, followed by the Hilux and Yaris. Perodua closed 2021 with sales of 22,940 units in December, 13.0 per cent higher than the 20,299 units sold in November 2021, mainly due to the recovery in the supply chain. Overall, Perodua's lower 2021 sales volume was affected by the Full Movement Control Order (FMCO), the semiconductor chips shortage and the December flooding, which disrupted the operations of a few of its vendors in the Klang Valley. Perodua's best-selling model for the year was the Myvi, followed by the Axia and Bezza. UMW Holdings president and group chief exective officer Datuk Ahmad Fuaad Kenali said both UMW Toyota and Perodua had shown resilience and performed well considering the headwinds and challenges during the year. 'The encouraging outstanding order book, introduction of new models as well as the extension of the sales tax exemption until June 30 2022 are expected to sustain the automotive sales recovery in 2022,' Ahmad Fuaad said in a statement on Friday. 'We wish to express our appreciation and thank you to our customers for their continuous support and we look forward to serving them better in 2022,' he added."}
