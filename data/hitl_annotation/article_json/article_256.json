{"text": "BEFORE the Malaysia Cup started, no one expected lightweights Sarawak United to go far.    But surprise, surprise, the East Malaysians have come out of the group stage, looking good.    Sarawak are the only Premier League side left in the quarter-finals, and that at the expense of East Coast powerhouse Sri Pahang.   On Sunday, underdogs Sarawak pulled off a come-from-behind 2-1 victory against Pahang at Stadium Darul Makmur in Kuantan.   Abdul Rahim Razak's goal in the fourth minute of injury time  eliminated Pahang early from the Malaysia Cup.  Sarawak, second in Group A, got an unassailable four-point lead over Pahang.   The Golden Hornbill  worked hard for the sensational victory, which they fully deserved, even though Dollah Salleh's Pahang controlled much of  the match.    Sarawak coach E. Elavarasan praised his men for their never-say-die attitude despite being under pressure throughout the match.   'From early on, Pahang looked better than us. Their early goal shocked us but we managed to give a response,' said Elavarasan.   'In the second half, Pahang were still the better side until we got the last minute goal.    'When it got to 1-1, it gave us the motivation that we can't lose this game.  'We accept the good fortune that came with the late counter that got us the goal and the victory.'   Kenny Athiu had given Pahang the lead in the 13th minute with a header, but  Sandro da Silva equalised for Sarawak in the 31st minute, and it was a goal that got the visitors thinking that victory was possible,   Apart from Sarawak, the other team who booked their quarter-final ticket over the weekend were Kuala Lumpur City FC.    The City Boys continued their rich vein of form with a vital 1-0 win over Penang."}
