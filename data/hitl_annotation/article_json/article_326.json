{"text": "HE hasn't played a single match for Malaysia, zero experience with the national team. Thus, one can imagine coach Tan Cheng Hoe's task of grafting Johan Dion Cools into the national team within days despite his remarkable credentials.   Some football followers may even say it's a great irony   that the talented Cools, who plays for Danish club FC Midtjylland, is a 'misfit' because of the circumstances.   But it will be dumbfounding for Malaysia not to utilise the 24-year-old Cools when his playing level is at the highest in Europe - having seen action in the Champions League against the likes of Liverpool, Manchester United, Real Madrid and Ajax.   However, Cheng Hoe has sidestepped the Co ols question, refusing to even confirm he will play in Malaysia's World Cup qualifiers in Dubai next month.    But the word is already out; right-back Cools will be on a plane to Dubai from Denmark, come June 31.  Even the player's Danish club have announced that he will be playing for Malaysia.    When Timesport asked about Cools yesterday,  Cheng Hoe declined to comment on the talk that the player will join the Malaysian team for the pre-World Cup/Asian Cup campaign.   As FAM take a hush-hush stand on Cools' role, Cheng Hoe insisted that he is only focusing on the 25 players that he has in Bahrain. Malaysia were scheduled to play an international friendly against Bahrain in the city of Riffa last night.   Born to a Belgian father and Malaysian mother, Cools has an impressive record, one that is unmatched by any Harimau Malaya player.    Apart from having played against some of Europe's big guns, Cools won both the Belgium championship and Belgian Super Cup twice with Club Brugge KV.    The defender also helped FC Midtjylland capture the Danish Championship in the 2019-2020 season.  At international level, he recorded 28 youth caps for the Belgium team.   However, the Kuching-born Cools, who has never played in the M-League or joined national training before, will have only three days to fit into Harimau Malaya's style of play before the pre-World Cup match against the United Arab Emirates on June 3.    Cheng Hoe will certainly have much on his mind in deciding between  Cools, Matthew Davies and Rizal Ghazali for the right-back position."}
