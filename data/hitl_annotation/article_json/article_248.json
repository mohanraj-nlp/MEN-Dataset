{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR: ABB Malaysia Sdn Bhd today signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Malaysian Green Technologyand Climate Change Corporation (MGTC) to formalise their collaboration on energy efficiency. The agreement outlines areas for collaboration, including awareness building, advocating the development of minimum efficiency standards for electric motors, engaging key stakeholders in knowledge sharing dialogues and establishing partnership networks to help industries identify energy-efficient technology and solutions that deliver the greatest value. It also comes at an important juncture given Malaysia's renewed commitment towards achieving net-zero by 2050 at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26). 'Our commitment to addressing climate change began even before the Paris Agreement was signed when the countryannounced its carbon mitigation target at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) meeting in 2009. 'We have come a long way, but more can be done, especially in increasing the uptake of energy efficiency,' MGTC chief executive officer Shamsul Bahar said in a statement. MGTC is an agency under the purview of the Ministry of Environment and Water (KASA) mandated to drive the country's green growth, climate change mitigation and green lifestyle agenda. Three national policies, particularly the National Green Technology Policy (NGTP), the National Climate Change Policy (NCCP) and the Green Technology Master Plan (GTMP), set out a coherent framework to drive the nation's low-carbon future. In joining the global initiative to combat climate change, Malaysia has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions intensity of gross domestic product (GDP) by 45 per cent in 2030 based on 2005 emission levels. ABB Malaysia country managing director and senior vice president Asia R Narayanan as a group, ABB in Malaysia is geared towards working with key stakeholders through four leading business areas: electrification, process automation, motion and robotics, and discrete automation. He said every industry sector is different, and ABB's full portfolio enables the company to offer unique solutions that allow local industry players to optimise their processes without causing irreversible damage to the environment. 'The MoU is a cornerstone in our commitment towards energising the transformation of societies for a sustainable future. 'Energy efficiency has been regarded as the first fuel to combat climate change by the International Energy Agency. 'By building a collaborative ecosystem involving governments, investors, industries and businesses, we can influence the biggest shift to accelerate Malaysia's clean energy revolution,' he said."}
