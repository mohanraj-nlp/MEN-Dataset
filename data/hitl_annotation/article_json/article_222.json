{"text": "After their training centre was rocked by a spate of Covid cases recently, BAM are set to be back in business today.    For the record, a total of 120 players, both seniors and juniors have been in self isolation at the Academy Badminton Malaysia (ABM) in Bukit Kiara after six players were first reported to be infected a fortnight ago.   Last week, eight more shuttlers  tested positive, and one more new case was reported on Sunday.  Of the 120 players, five shuttlers on the Road To Tokyo programme   Lee Zii Jia, Aaron Chia, Soh Wooi Yik, Chow Mei Kuan and Lee Meng Yean   have received the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.   'BAM confirms that the Ministry of Health (MoH) has given the clearance for on-court training at the ABM in Bukit Kiara to resume, starting tomorrow (today).   'A quarantine-based approach to training with strict compliance to standard operating procedures (SOPs) is set to be conducted at the national badminton centre of excellence.   'It will allow our athletes to return to court in a safe and controlled environment as per the directives by health authorities.   'The association would like to record sincere appreciation to the MoH, Sports Ministry, National Sports Council, and National Sports Institute for the hard work put in to ensure the immediate resumption of national badminton training programme,' BAM said in a  statement issued yesterday.   After the first Movement Control Order (MCO) was declared in March last year, all national players were sent back to their homes before they were brought back in batches starting in June, 2020.   Since then, BAM adopted a quarantine-style training programme to ensure that none of their players or coaches were exposed to the coronavirus.   This seemed to work for the national squad, as no one tested positive, even when the players and coaches travelled overseas for tournaments.   The Malaysian badminton squad have competed in more overseas tournaments this year than any other sport in the country.    Since January, BAM's players have travelled to Thailand, Switzerland, England, France and Poland.   While the India Open, scheduled for May 11-16, has been postponed, BAM shuttlers are  expected to travel to Europe next month for the Slovenia International on May 19-22, Spain Masters (May 18-23) and Austrian Open on May 27-30.   BAM are also expected to push on with their plans to host the Malaysia Open, an Olympic qualifying event, on May 25-30 at the Axiata Arena."}
