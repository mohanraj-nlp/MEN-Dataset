{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Boat owners have banded together with young volunteers to mobilise their boats to assist flood-battered Taman Sri Muda residents in Selangor.  One of the volunteers, Mokham Singh, said floodwater has completely inundated the area and all communication lines have come to a halt.  Mokham, in a short video uploaded on his Twitter handle @MokhamS, said volunteers will be deploying a mega boat to continue evacuation missions in the area.  Mokham said, boat owners have volunteered to brave the floodwater and rescue victims trapped in their homes and buildings.  'As far as I can see, there is water everywhere. It is so bad that cars are under the boats.  'Fortunately, the water is slowly receding but this (the evacuation missions) might take two to three days.  'There is zero connection here. Once we are on the boat, we cannot access Google Maps or anything else (for navigation).  'Please have patience. There are umpteen amounts of boats today and I'm pretty sure we'll be here tomorrow and the day after as well,' he said.  At present, land vehicles are unable to access Taman Sri Muda as houses and buildings are submerged.  Another Twitter user @GatoCannon also posted a video showing groups of volunteers unloading several boats at the area.  The Fire and Rescue Department, he said, has also dispatched their personnel and assets to the scene to expedite relief efforts.  Heavy downpours since Friday has left major parts of Selangor inundated, with Taman Sri Muda being one of the worst-hit areas.  Most residents in the area have climbed to rooftops as water levels surged but were left without aid for over 48 hours.  Selangor Menteri Besar Datuk Seri Amirudin Shari, who joined the rescue mission last night, also said that more boats are being deployed to Taman Sri Muda, Bukit Kemuning and Hulu Langat areas."}
