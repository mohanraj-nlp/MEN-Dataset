{"text": "Former international Datuk James Selvaraj (pic) will not blame the national badminton squad if they fall short in their bid to bring back a medal from the Tokyo Olympics later this month. According to James, the players are already under tremendous pressure to perform in Japan due to the Covid-19 pandemic that continues to wreak havoc in most parts of the world, including Malaysia. Since the pandemic hit full-scale last year, Malaysian shuttlers have had no choice but to train behind closed doors in a safe bubble at the Academy Badminton Malaysia (ABM) in Bukit Kiara. With limited tournament experience and top-quality sparring over the last one year, James will understand if the team fail to produce their best in Tokyo. 'Let's face it, the players bound for Tokyo are already under tremendous pressure. And this is not pressure coming from badminton but by a virus that continues to cause so many problems. 'Sure, our athletes have all been vaccinated, but that does not guarantee anyone from getting the virus. 'With so many restrictions and rules from swab tests, to no mingling with others, no physical contact and quarantine, how do you expect a player to perform? 'I don't even understand why the Games this year is still going ahead.  'Just look at the Euros. Reports are already coming out that it is a Covid-19 hotspot as  fans tested positive after watching the matches at stadiums. 'This is how I feel,' James told Timesport recently. This year, Malaysia will be represented in all five disciplines. Those who have qualified are Lee Zii Jia (men's singles), Aaron Chia-Soh Wooi Yik (men's doubles), Soniia Cheah (women's singles), Chow Mei Kuan-Lee Meng Yean (women's doubles) and 2016 Rio Olympics silver medallists Chan Peng Soon-Goh Liu Ying (mixed doubles). Since badminton was introduced at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Malaysia have only returned home empty-handed twice in 2000 (Sydney) and 2004 (Athens). The national contingent are expected to leave for Tokyo on July 17."}
