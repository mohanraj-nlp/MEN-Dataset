{"text": "Badminton England (BE) have drawn flak from fans in their own country for withdrawing their national team from the Thomas Cup Finals starting Saturday in Aarhus, Denmark, at the 11th hour.    BE's shock move is seen by many as making a mockery of the Thomas Cup, for long, the most prestigious international men's team competition,   And this is not the first time. In  2018, England pulled out from the Thomas Cup in Bangkok, leading to Hong Kong coming in as a replacement.   But this time, there will be no substitute. Group D will have just three teams, Malaysia, Japan and Canada.    BE, the national body for English badminton, cited injuries to three singles players for their decision to give the Thomas Cup finals a miss.   However, English fans are not convinced, with many voicing their annoyance in social media.   'Give the chance to the next best players. They're all in universities, so they'd be available to play,' said a Twitter user.    'Not offering the opportunity to the next best players isn't inspiring, and isn't fair to the doubles players,' said another Twitter user.    A fan commented: 'Biggest men's tournament in the events calendar and we haven't even got enough decent players to send a team! Embarrassing.'    The four English singles shuttlers,  who were initially selected for the Thomas Cup were world No 51 Toby Penty, Johnnie Torjussen (No 198), Harry Huang (No 319) and Ethan Rose (No 436).    England national champion Torjussen was the only player who featured in all three group ties at the recent Sudirman Cup in Finland.    BE have come under heavy criticism over the last few months, especially after they dropped world No 12 men's doubles, Marcus Ellis-Chris Langridge from the Tokyo Olympics in July.    A fortnight ago, BE long-serving chief executive, Adrian Christy, stepped down after helming the organisation for 15 years, raising more questions on the stability of the national body.   It remains to be seen if England, the founding country of the Thomas Cup, will face sanctions from the Badminton World Federation for their last-minute withdrawal.    England's 'lack of respect' for the Thomas Cup does not go well with sporting spirit, and their action also deprives other teams of a chance to compete in the hallowed competition."}
