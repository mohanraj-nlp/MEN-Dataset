{"text": "KOTA KINABALU: Sabah is likely to have low booster and child immunisation (PICKids) rates as both are non-mandatory.   The state Immunisation Task Force director Datuk Shahelmey Yahya said the authorities were aware there have been attempts to discourage people from taking boosters and child vaccines.   'They are doing it by spreading stories on the side effects after booster shots, though not backed by scientific data and proof.   'On the other hand, I notice the real reason why the status of booster shots is still low is because there is an option.   'Some people could be complacent due to that. But I hope many will realise the importance of getting boosted after a certain period of time,' he told the New Straits Times.   According to the Health Ministry's Covidnow website, only 21 percent of 2,103,971 fully vaccinated adults received their boosters.   For children aged between 5 and 11 in Sabah, only 13,650 or 3.3 per cent of eligible recipients received the vaccines.   This week, there were 1,829 cases involving young children or 7.7 per cent of the total Covid-19 weekly cases.   'We hope our community will be more aware and realise the need to get booster shots and child vaccinations as the current infection rate in the state has gone higher.   'Awareness programmes are also being conducted in Sabah every day through the Jabatan Kesihatan Negeri Sabah Facebook and RTM Sabah.'   The programme has since been extended throughout the state with the setting up of 145 vaccine administering centres (PPV) involving 109 health clinics, 22 hospitals, 18 private clinics and four public PPVs, monitored by specialists and medical officers.   Shahelmey, who is also the state Community Development and People's Wellbeing chairman, said these facilities also allow walk-in services.   As for the outreach programme, he said the state health department is working with the state government on various outreach vaccinations by setting up temporary centres at community halls or government offices.   The PICKids vaccination programme, which will be held at 1,705 primary schools, is also aimed at ensuring parents, including in the interior, bring their children to get the first dose of vaccine, to increase the vaccination rates.   Although some schools will have the abrupt closure due to Covid-19 cases, he said the programmes would be continued until March."}
