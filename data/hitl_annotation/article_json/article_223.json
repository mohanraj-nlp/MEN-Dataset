{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR: SMTrack Bhd is currently in the advanced discussion stage with the relevant parties for the RM1.2 billion redevelopment project in Kampong Bharu. Deputy executive chairman Azmi Osman said negotiations with Jiankun International Bhd (JIB) on the potential bid to be the project management consultant (PMC) for the redevelopment project has entered into advanced stages. 'We bid for this role due to the project's strategic location, size, and job scope.  'Given our expertise and efficient project management experience, we believe this will be a win-win collaboration for both companies,' he said in a statement today. On 26 January 2022, JIB signed a joint venture (JV) agreement with Menara Rezeki Sdn Bhd (MRSB) and Menara Rezeki Properties Sdn Bhd (MRP) to undertake the redevelopment of the existing Flat PKNS Jalan Tun Razak in Kampong Bharu. The redevelopment project includes relocating existing residents into a new apartment with a comprehensive compensation package. Once the relocation has been completed, the demolition of the Flat PKNS will be conducted responsibly without affecting the local communities in the area. This would then be followed by the redevelopment and construction works.  According to Azmi, the redevelopment project is a promising prospect, given SMTrack's expertise and track record in project management. 'This is a good opportunity for us to utilise our expertise and healthy financial position through value-accretive efforts such as this to enhance the company's earnings visibility going forward,' Azmi said.  Aside from the potential return of earnings, SMTrack - a Bursa Malaysia listed radio frequency identification (RFID) solution provider, is also relishing the opportunity to contribute to the community through this redevelopment project.  The positive impact of this project, which includes the encouragement of new investment, improves local infrastructure and provide multiplier effects that benefit the local communities. 'I wish to reiterate that while the advanced talks with the relevant parties have been promising, nothing is confirmed at this point.  'A detailed announcement will be made in due course under the listing requirements of Bursa Malaysia once the company has obtained further information,' Azmi said."}
