MoH said people must cleanse themselves with clean water if they have come into contact with flood waters. It added that they must also wash their hands properly and always uphold high standard of hygiene practices. 'Do not shower yourself or wash anything or food items using flood waters, but always go for clean water and bottled water for drinking and wash food items.' The ministry also urged all to keep evacuation centres clean and hygienic so as to avoid turning them into breeding ground for flies and rats. It advised all to use personal protective gear such as gloves and boots when they are engaged in post-floods cleaning. 'Do not hesitate to seek medical attention if you experience a fever within 30 days after the cleaning task,' added MoH.

He said continuous rain had been forecast in the state from Dec 27 to 29, particularly along the western side of Sarawak due to the monsoon surge."}
