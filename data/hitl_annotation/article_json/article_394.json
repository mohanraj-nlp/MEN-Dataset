{"text": "KOTA KINABALU: Sabah Progressive Party (SAPP) is glad that several issues for which it fought for almost three decades are taking shape now.  Its president Datuk Yong Teck Lee said the party was formed more than a generation ago and saw the country going through many political changes, especially in the last four years.   'The new normal of Malaysia is power sharing among several political parties. In the case of SAPP, I can see the increase in power sharing between Sabah and Sarawak, and the federal government.  'This is the great window of opportunity that SAPP has been speaking of since 2008,' he said in a statement in conjunction with the party's 28th anniversary.   Yong added that since 2010, the party had also brought the Malaysia Agreement 1963 (MA63) to the national mainstream by way of a by-election.   'Progress on MA63 compliance is finally taking shape. Among the key struggles of the party is the Sabah identity card for legitimate Malaysians in Sabah, the return of Labuan to Sabah and the just sharing of our oil and gas natural resources, all of which are consistent with compliance to MA63.'   The former chief minister also said the party, which is part of Perikatan Nasional, continues to pursue land reforms including the revival of 999-year land tenure, and the Residency System of decentralised government, as well as finding truths to the Double 6 tragedy in 1976.  He reminded SAPP members to be on a high level of situational awareness to understand the political intrigues happening around Sabah and at the federal level.   'Only when we have situational awareness, then we can have constructive engagements with other political parties who share a common purpose with SAPP.'  Yong also extended appreciation to members for their loyalty and dedication even though the party has very little access to political power at the moment.   Despite the limitations, he said he was confident that SAPP members will continue to do their very best to serve the people and to propel Sabah and Malaysia to greater heights."}
