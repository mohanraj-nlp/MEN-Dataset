{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Fashion designer Datuk Jovian Mandagie has denied claims that he had used a government-owned helicopter for personal use to rescue himself from the recent floods which recently crippled large parts of the Klang Valley. Jovian, who is the son-in-law of Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob, said he was not the sort to use what was not his, and labeled the accusations as lies. Taking to Instagram, he said those who know him personally would be aware of his character. 'On this helicopter issue, there's no need to prolong it. I wasn't showing off. If I was showing off, I would have been posing and making a video and taking lots of pictures. 'Those who know me know I'm not that type. I didn't use government assets. It's not possible that I would use something that wasn't meant for me. 'If you guys want to insult me, go ahead but those are lies,' he wrote. Jovian also addressed criticism online that he didn't use the helicopter to help other people. 'Why wasn't the helicopter used to help other people? The answer is that it was a commercial helicopter and as such, cannot open its doors to lower aid or airlift victims,' he said. Jovian added that those who were unhappy with him are free to unfollow him on social media. 'If you don't like me, don't follow me. It's better to help the country than to continue accusing me of untruths. 'There are many more things out there which need to be done to help the people. Yes, there are people suffering. If you want to go to the ground to help distribute food, let me know,' he said."}
