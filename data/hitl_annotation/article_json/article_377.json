{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 28  Bursa Malaysia extended Friday's gains to start the week higher today, lifted by persistent bargain-hunting predominantly by foreign funds, a dealer said. At 9.03am, the benchmark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI (FBM KLCI) gained 9.94 points to 1,601.66 compared with 1,591.72 at Friday's close. The market bellwether opened 4.02 points higher at 1,595.74. On the broader market, gainers outpaced losers 223 to 109, while 255 counters were unchanged, 1,691 untraded and 51 others suspended. Turnover stood at 142.75 million units valued at RM70.12 million. Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd vice-president of Equity Research Thong Pak Leng said Wall Street remained defiant with a strong upswing despite the ongoing tensions in Ukraine, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI Average) jumping 835 points to surge above the 34,000 level, while Nasdaq was 221 points higher. 'Whether such buying can sustain, it remains to be seen,' he told Bernama. Back home, he said the FBM KLCI is expected to continue its uptrend within the 1,585-1,600 range today, in view of a slew of good corporate earnings of late. 'We also noticed that consensus began to take heed of the strong crude palm oil prices and upgrading their average price assumptions,' he said.
