{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Tanah Melayu Capital Bhd (TMCB) will sign an agreement with Kazakhstan's Ministry of Trade and Integration to establish Qazaq Trade Hub, the country's regional trade hub, in Kuala Lumpur. The Qazaq Trade Hub, the first of its kind in Southeast Asia, is a comprehensive one-stop centre to enhance trade and investment between Kazakhstan and Malaysia.  It will also be a primary platform for Kazakhstan to reach out and engage other countries within the Southeast Asia region to bolster commercial opportunities and business activities. TMCB director Ridhwan Rosli said the company is deeply appreciative of the trust and confidence showed by the Kazakhstan Ministry of Trade and Integration in appointing TMCB to spearhead the Qazaq Trade Hub project in Malaysia. 'TMCB is able to combine our expertise in information communications and technology (ICT) alongside our local market insights and relationship with key public and private stakeholders to make Qazaq Trade Hub a success,' he said in a statement today. TMCB is a home-grown information technology and business networking specialist. A digital MoU signing ceremony will be held in the nearest date and will be witnessed by the head of state from both Kazakhstan and Malaysia. According to Ridhwan, Malaysia's strategic location in the heart of Southeast Asia makes it an ideal site for the Qazaq Trade Hub.  'Malaysia is currently Kazakhstan's largest trading partner in the region, with the trade of about RM600 million in value per annum.  'The presence of this hub is expected to bolster trade further while potentially drive more foreign direct investments into Malaysia,' he added. Republic of Kazakhstan Trade and Integration vice-minister Assel Zhubanyshevna Zhanassova said the Qazaq Trade Hub reaffirms that the country is open for business and is pro-actively seeking avenues to grow and diversify trade and investment in the spirit of global economic collaboration. 'Kazakhstan has a lot of products, technologies and talent to offer Malaysia and its neighbours in the Southeast Asia region and vice versa.  'Growth in exports and imports between our country and the region can only be mutually beneficial to our respective economy and society,' she added. 'Given our geographical location, Kazakhstan can also be a transit hub between Southeast Asia and Europe, in particular nations of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU).  'This transit hub would enable new trade paradigms that can generate jobs, enrich lives and secure our natural resources, she said. Assel said in order to fully unlock the value of the country's relationship with Malaysia and Southeast Asia, it is critical that both parties work alongside a partner like TMCB who not only knows the local market and stakeholders but is also able to bring a technological edge to positioning Kazakhstan as an attractive trade and investment destination."}
