{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Johor Darul Ta'zim (JDT) went down 1-0 to Japan's Nagoya Grampus in their Asian Champions League (ACL) Group G opener at the Rajamangala Stadium in Bangkok yesterday.    Midfielder Hiroyuki Abe's controversial goal in the 60th minute handed the Japanese side full points.   The match was a closely contested affair in the first half with both sides finding it hard to break through. And it turned scrappy, leading to both sides picking up two yellow cards each.    JDT's teen winger Arif Aiman Hanapi was the bright spark for the Malaysian side on the left flank, and he came close to scoring in the 42nd minute. But his attempt was saved by the Grampus keeper.    The second half saw both teams stringing together more fluid moves, having settled down. And JDT striker Bergson looked dangerous with his attempts. However, the Brazilian's two attempts were not on target.   Off a counter-attack, Nagoya got the only goal of the evening.    It happened when the Southern Tigers seemed to switch off inside their box, and expected an offside call from the referee. But it never came, and Abe fired home from close range after receiving a pass from Ryogo Yamasaki in the 60th minute.   After seizing the lead, Nagoya tightened their defence, and relied on  counter-attacks. And the Japanese side  could have added at least two more goals if they had been more clinical in their finishing.   JDT seemed to have got the equaliser in the 92nd minute from Bergson's header, but referee Mohammed Abdulla Hassan disallowed the goal as  Bergson was adjudged to have fouled Nagoya defender Shinnosuke Nakatani.   JDT's next group match is against Thailand's Ratchaburi at the Rajamangala Stadium on Friday."}
