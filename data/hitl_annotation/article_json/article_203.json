{"text": "KOTA KINABALU: Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS) has been having unofficial meetings on its formalisation, said Sabah Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu) deputy chief Datuk Seri Masidi Manjun. GRS comprises Barisan Nasional, Perikatan Nasional and Parti Bersatu Sabah. It was formed during the 2020 state election. These few days, several Bersatu leaders had called for the coalition to be registered to ensure unity among party component leaders. 'Put it this way, just because there is no announcement (of the progress), it does not mean nothing has been done. 'We have been having informal meetings but it is only proper to be announced when it is done (officially),' he said when met during the 2022 Sabah International Business and Economic Summit here. When asked whether other component party leaders were keen to register the coalition, Masidi said he could not say due to the respective party's stance but said some leaders were eager with the idea. Among those who voiced out about the issue were Bersatu Information chief Khairul Firdaus Akbar and Sabah Armada Chief Fairuz Renddan. Khairul had said that the existing leadership under the GRS government would be able to bring Sabah to the pinnacle of success. He had also added that the never-ending political situation in Peninsular Malaysia should prompt Sabah leaders to chart a direction based on the interests of Sabahans. Fairuz, who is also Pintasan assemblyman, said solidarity among leaders in the GRS is proof they keep their promises and did not underestimate the message given by the people in the last State Election (PRN). 'The people chose us, we move as a coalition chosen by the people of Sabah and for that purpose, it is appropriate for us to continue to move and work to realise what the people expect.'"}
