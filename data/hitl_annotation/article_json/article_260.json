{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 15  Bursa Malaysia opened higher in early trade today, on bargain-hunting after experiencing a heavy sell-off yesterday, despite a weaker performance on Wall Street. The United States (US) shares turned risk averse heading into major central bank meetings and lingering worries over the spread of the Omicron variant, dealers said At 9.52am, the benchmark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI (FBM KLCI) rose 2.63 points to 1,483.55 compared with 1,480.92 at Tuesday's close. The index opened 0.93 of-a-point better at 1,481.85. On the broader market, losers led gainers 242 to 239, while 313 counters were unchanged, 1,523 untraded and 19 others suspended. Turnover stood at 452.51 million units valued at RM244.20 million. Malacca Securities Sdn Bhd said the FBM KLCI slipped from Monday's rebound, in tandem with the global stock markets performances yesterday.

'Also, investors are likely to remain cautious amid inflationary pressure and are taking a pause ahead of the Sarawak state election,' it said.
