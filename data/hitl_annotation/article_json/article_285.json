{"text": "The BA of Malaysia (BAM) believe players bound for tournaments overseas should not face any problem  doing so as long as they test negative for Covid-19. Yesterday, the national body confirmed that six players tested positive and are already in isolation, away from the rest of the shuttlers and coaches at the Academy Badminton Malaysia (ABM) in Bukit Kiara. Pending a review tomorrow, training has been brought to a halt. But BAM are confident that quarantine-based training could resume soon. BAM secretary-general Datuk Kenny Goh told Timesport that swift actions have been taken to contain the spread of the virus. 'I believe once the self-isolation period is over, and if players test negative, there should be no problem for them to travel and compete. As long as we follow the standard operating procedures strictly, it should be fine. 'We needed to take swift actions to contain the spread,' said Kenny. It is learnt that the six players did not contract the virus from any of the tournaments they had competed in. The national shuttlers had played in three back-to-back tournaments in January in Bangkok, the Swiss Open, All England, Orleans Masters and Polish Open last month. For the elite players and those bound for the Tokyo Olympics in July, their next assignment is the India Open on May 11-16. The India Open is also an Olympic qualifying event. For some of the backup and 10 junior players, they will travel to Europe for the Slovenia International Series on May 19-22 and the Austrian Open on May 27-30. One of the six is an up-and-coming shuttler who surprised the form book in a tournament two years ago."}
