{"text": "KOTA BARU: Many recipients in Kelantan are still refusing to get their Covid-19 booster shots, says the state government.  Deputy Menteri Besar Datuk Mohd Amar Nik Abdullah believes they refused to take the third dose as they thought that the third round of vaccination was not compulsory.  'We (the state government) realise that many locals are still not taking their booster shots and we also can't force them to take the dose.  'But we would like to urge the elderly as well as those with chronic diseases to take the shot for protection,' he said.  Mohd Amar who is the Panchor assemblyman said despite the slow response, the state government would continue with its campaign to encourage locals to get their booster shots.  The relevant authorities will also continue to announce which vaccination centre provides booster shots.  'The public can go to these centres directly to take their shots,' he said.  State health director Datuk Dr Zaini Hussin recently said the number of adults above 18 who received their Covid-19 booster shots in Kelantan is still low, compared to the number of those eligible to receive them.  He said the department has recorded 90,316 adults who had taken their booster shots as of last week.  Dr Zaini cited several reasons for the slow response, such as many believed that the booster shot was not important and not compulsory compared to the first and second doses which they believed were important as it would have prevented them from participating in certain activities.  To encourage adults to get their booster shots, he said the department would increase its outreach programmes and campaign activities, particularly to the target groups."}
