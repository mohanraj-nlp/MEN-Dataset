{"text": "TERENGGANU coach Nafuzi Zain hopes this year's AFC Cup will not be cancelled. The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) will decide later this week whether to cancel or hold the tournament as they have yet to secure venues for Group G, H and I. 'We are now preparing for the challenge. Hopefully, it will not be cancelled as the players are excited to play against the top teams in this region.  'My players are mentally and physically prepared for the challenge. 'We want to use this tournament to expose our youngsters.' Terengganu qualified for the AFC Cup by finishing third in last season's Super League. 'We have registered several up-and-coming players from our reserve team for the tournament.'  Terengganu are second in the Super League with 27 points from 13 matches, with Johor Darul Ta'zim at the top on 30."}
