{"text": "Melaka United coach Zainal Abidin Hassan has warned his charges to remain cautious despite the 1-0 win over Sabah in the first leg of the Malaysia Cup quarter-finals. Haitian striker Sony Norde was the toast of Melaka with a strike in the 52nd minute at Likas Stadium on Sunday to maintain the Mousedeer's unbeaten run in the competition. Melaka will entertain Ong Kim Swee's Sabah in the return leg at Hang Jebat Stadium on Thursday. Although delighted, Zainal warned his players not to celebrate yet. 'Sabah gave us a tough challenge, and the tie is not over yet.  'We dominated the first half but could not score. We could have won by a bigger margin,' said Zainal on Sunday. 'It is just the first half of the tie. We have another half to play at home.' 'The good thing is we won away and did not concede a goal. It offers us a slight advantage.' Melaka are seeking their first semi-final appearance since 1983. Meanwhile, Terengganu edged Sarawak United 2-1 at Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin Stadium in Gong Badak. Terengganu scored through Faisal Halim (16th minute) and Faiz Nasir (51st).  Sarawak United are still alive in the tie thanks to Terengganu defender Shahril Nizam Ros Hasni's own goal in the 21st minute. In another match, Kedah were held to a 0-0 draw by Johor Darul Ta'zim at Darulaman Stadium in Alor Star."}
