{"text": "Defender Harith Haikal Adam Afkar hopes to play for the national youth side in the AFC Under-23 qualifiers in Mongolia on Oct 25-31. However, the Selangor-born may not get his wish as the Red Giants have yet to release him for international duty. Selangor are undecided as they may need him for the Malaysia Cup due to injuries in their squad. Harith said he will be disappointed if he does not join Brad Maloney's side for the qualifiers. 'It is still 50-50 after discussions with FA of Selangor technical director Michael Feichtenbeiner and coach Karsten Neitzel,' said Harith. 'It is my dream to play for the country, and even if I am released a few days before the qualifiers, I will go for it.' 'The Malaysia Cup is an annual tournament, and there is always a chance for me next year.  'However, the Mongolia assignment is my big chance to shine as I may not get a call up again in the future.' Harith added: 'Maloney wants me to play for his team. However, there are injury issues at Selangor. I have to wait and see whether I am released for the qualifiers.' In 2019, the Klang-born Harith helped the national youth team finish runners-up in the AFF Under-18 Championship.  He was also in the squad for the 2019 Philippines Sea Games but warmed the bench. Malaysia will open their Group J campaign in the qualifiers against Laos on Oct 25, followed by Mongolia three days later and Thailand on Oct 31.  Maloney's side will leave for Ulaanbaatar on Oct 20."}
