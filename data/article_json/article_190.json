Chief executive officer Datuk Mahmud Abbas said PKNS' goal was to create a better life for all, anchoring on good governance, commitment to the environment, as well as social and economic growth of the state and nation.\u00a0 'PKNS' commitment is to enhance existing townships and developments and rejuvenate existing developments by introducing new concepts, repurposing spaces, injecting contemporary designs, and conserving natural gems.\u00a0 'We believe by doing so, our developments will continue to excite the community, be it home buyers or entrepreneurs, and uphold the state as an attractive hub for investors,' he said at PKNS' 2022 outlook briefing today. Mahmud said PKNS was expected to roll out development plans for 2022 and to see growth both economically and socially in the state of Selangor. PKNS applied a holistic approach to the state's development, eyeing 12 new projects valued at an estimated RM690 million in gross development value (GDV) for 2022.\u00a0 PKNS said it had set a target to achieve about RM584 million sales for 2022.\u00a0 This would be underpinned by the strength of its property portfolio comprising over 160,000 homes built across 26,102ha and industrial developments spanning 4,809.68ha. PKNS is optimistic of achieving its targets and unlocking greater value for the state, the community and its stakeholders. As at January 21 this year, PKNS had a landbank size of 2,417 hectares and expected to develop the land with the right mix of developments to match emerging market demands.\u00a0 The composition of PKNS' landbank represents 44 per cent commercial, 13 per cent residential, and 43 per cent mix developments with the largest parcels strategically around economic gateways in Klang, Bernama Jaya and Hulu Langat. PKNS witnessed a growing demand in its mid-range homes evident with the encouraging take up rates for its Rafflesia (Bernama Jaya), Puteri Daffina X (Kota Puteri), Antara Gapi; Selangor Cyber Valley, and Residensi Aurora. PKNS delivered over 4,000 affordable homes under its Rumah Selangorku range in the past year. PKNS is entrusted with the responsibility to drive economic and social growth as the development arm of Selangor.\u00a0 Established in 1964, the corporation has developed 11 self-sufficient townships across Selangor included a mix of residential growth centres and industrial parks in its 58 years of operations"}
