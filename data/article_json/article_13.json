{"text": "MUKAH: A Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS) candidate who is defending her Dalat state seat has incorporated something different in her campaign trail for the coming state polls.  Though Dalat is among the 64 constituencies allowed to organise physical ceramahs, Datuk Seri Fatimah Abdullah and her campaigning team have deployed 10 people on jet skis to help her win support among the 12,503 registered voters there.  Flying flags with the GPS logo, these jet ski riders were spotted along Sungai Batang Oya since a majority of voters in Dalat are residing near the river.  'This is the method we are using in the campaign for the state election since the SOPs implemented during the period are quite strict.  'Those on the jet skis began their journey from the jetty in Oya until the upstream of Batang Oya river,' she said.  Fatimah is a going against Salleh Mahali of Parti Bumi Kenyalang in a straight fight to defend her Dalat state seat during the 12th Sarawak election, which has been fixed for early voting and polling on Dec 14 and Dec 18 respectively.     In the previous state election, Fatimah retained the seat after she secured a 6,330 majority against Sim Eng Hua of PKR.  As Sarawak is still under Phase Three of the National Recovery Plan and the country is still battling the on-going Covid-19 pandemic, the SOPs for the state election are similar to those enforced during the Melaka polls and are strict to prevent the spread of the virus.  The Election Commission (EC), however, recently relaxed the restrictions and allowed physical ceramahs to be held in 64 constituencies, mostly in rural parts of the state with poor 4G coverage subject to conditions and strict compliance with the SOPs."}
