{"text": "Selangor  are getting from bad to worse day by day in the Super League. They were once the undisputed champions of Malaysian football but are now struggling against smaller teams in the M-League. On Saturday, the Red Giants failed to earn maximum points when they hosted Melaka United at the MBPJ Stadium. Karsten Neitzel's side started brightly by taking the lead through Hein Htet Aung in the 19th minute.  However, disaster struck nine minutes later. Selangor were down to 10 players when defender Ashmawi Yakin was sent off for rough play. With the team playing defensively after the red card, Melaka started to dominate proceedings. And Zainal Abidin Hassan's side was rewarded when Manuel Ott scored the equaliser in the fourth minute of stoppage time. The 1-1 draw ended their four-match winning streak in the competition. 'We started well and created a few chances before scoring a goal. But the red card affected our game,' said Neitzel on Saturday. 'In the second half, we did not do so well, although we created a few chances.' Selangor are fifth in the standings with 33 points, with two matches left to play. Melaka, meanwhile, are eighth with 18 points. They will complete their season against Perak on Friday and Kedah on Sept 12. 'It is always not easy playing against a team who have only 10 players on the pitch. Anyway, it is still good that we earned a point,' said Zainal. 'We need at least three points from our remaining two matches to secure our Super League spot for next season. 'It is a tight season as any two of the bottom six teams could get relegated. We will fight until the end to achieve our mission.'"}
