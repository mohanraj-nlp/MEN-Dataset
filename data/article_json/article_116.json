{"text": "PONTIAN: Menteri Besar Datuk Hasni Mohammad has hinted that he will defend the Benut State Assembly seat in the Johor State Election.  The Johor Umno Liaison Committee Chairman said he wanted to retain the N53 seat.  'If I can and given the opportunity, I want to contest in Benut again,' he said at a press conference after presenting the Chinese New Year contribution at the Benut state assembly here today.  Benut is one of the two-state assembly seats which comes under the Pontian Parliament, apart from the Pulai Sebatang state seat.  Hasni has been the incumbent of the Benut state seat for three terms since the 12th General Election (GE12) in 2008.  In GE14, Hasni defeated Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu) candidates Zulkifly Tasrep and Mohd Firdaus Jaafar (PAS) with a majority of 4,447 votes.  Asked of reports that the younger brother of the Selangor Menteri Besar, Datuk Seri Amirudin Shari, was among the candidates mentioned that are likely to contest in the Benut state seat in the state election, Hasni just smiled.  'The more people, the more lively,' he said.  It was reported earlier today that Aziz Shari, 33, who is also the Pontian PKR Angkatan Muda Keadilan chief, will likely contest the Benut seat."}
