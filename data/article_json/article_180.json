{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR: RAM Ratings Services Bhd has assigned a preliminary AA1/Stable rating to Widad Concession Sdn Bhd's (Widad Concession) RM310 million sukuk wakalah facility. RAM Ratings said from a cash flow perspective, Widad Concession will be entirely dependent on YBK Usahasama Sdn Bhd YBKU and Serendah Heights Sdn Bhd to service its obligations under the proposed sukuk. Widad Concession, a fully-owned subsidiary of Widad Group Bhd (WGB), was set up to finance the acquisition cost of the private-public partnership (PPP) or project finance initiative (PFI) project held by YBKU. WGB completed the acquisition of YBKU's immediate holding company, Serendah Heights, in March 2021. Serendah Heights' business activity is only limited to YBKU. The rating agency said semi-annual murabahah stock repayments and dividends from the two entities would support these obligations. 'YBKU has also received prompt payments from UiTM since the completion of the campus on 30 January 2014. 'Performance-related deductions have been minimal at less than 1 per cent per annum,' it said. WGB group managing director Datuk Mohd Rizal bin Mohd Jaafar said the AA1 stable rating assigned by RAM reinforces WGB's confidence in its vision to continue building a robust business that emphasizes growth, productivity and financial strength. Rizal said the outlook for 2021 is difficult to predict, but with the completion of the company's acquisitions of concessionaires and strong expected cash flow, the company feels positive about spearheading the integrated facility management (IFM) industry as a formidable player going ahead. 'We are also optimistic about achieving our key-performance outcome and sustaining financial performance this year,' he said."}
