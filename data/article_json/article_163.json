{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Censof Holdings Bhd's (Censof) net profit increased 31 per cent to RM2.63 million in the third quarter (Q3) ended March 31, 2022, from RM2.01 million a year ago. The technology holdings company said this was achieved on the back of a revenue of RM21.3 million for Q3 2022. For the cumulative nine months (9M) period, revenue increased by 18.7 per cent to RM65.2 million from RM55.0 million in the previous year. Despite the higher revenue, the net profit was lower at RM6.51 million from RM14.09 million last year.\u00a0 This was mainly due to recognising non-recurring gain on disposal and fair value adjustment of short-term investments of RM2.1 million and RM9.4 million, respectively, in 9M FY21. Censof's financial position as of December 31, 2021, remained healthy with cash and bank balances, including fixed deposit and money market funds of RM27.3 million. Net assets per share attributable to ordinary equity holders of the company was 16.26 sen. Group managing director Ameer Shaik Mydin said Censof's third-quarter financial performance had demonstrated significant momentum as the company continues to stride till the end of its financial year. Ameer said the company has been making significant progress in its plans to capitalise on the industry's appetite to adopt digitalisation by the government and commercial sectors. 'We have been making progress by laying out the foundation to enhance the digital technology market through our joint venture with Cloocus Co Ltd to develop and operate Microsoft's cloud management in Malaysia. 'During the quarter, we successfully secured an iPayment contract worth RM13.5 million to facilitate cashless payments and collections for all government services by 2022,' he said. Meanwhile, Ameer said over the past few months, the company has undergone various exciting and positive developments. He said the company's recent acquisition of the 51 per cent equity stake in Cognitive Consulting Sdn Bhd had proven its commitment to grow the Digital Technology segment. 'As such, I am extremely optimistic of the company's prospects with our list of upcoming plans and developments at hand,' he added."}
