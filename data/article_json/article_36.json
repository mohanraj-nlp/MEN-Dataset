{"text": "KUCHING: Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS) candidate for Bukit Saban, Datuk Amar Douglas Uggah Embas, who is defending the Iban majority seat for a second time, is facing two new opponents in the 12th Sarawak election.   The caretaker deputy chief minister said while it may seem like a walk in the park for him, he and the coalition were not letting their guard down.  'For GPS, we take the election very seriously. We treat all our opponents as formidable opponents. We must never be overconfident,' the veteran politician told reporters after filing his nomination form at the sub-district office in Spaoh today.  He also reminded his supporters not to be overconfident in facing the election.  At the end of the day, we may regret it. We must make sure that our machinery is well oiled and in top gear to take on any challenges along the way,' he said.   'Our ultimate aim is to win and make sure the GPS forms the government again after this election,' said Uggah, a former Member of Parliament (MP) for Betong constituency which includes the Bukit Saban state seat. AdvertisementSkip Uggah will face-off in a three-cornered fight with PKR candidate Mikhael Matthew Abdullah and Andria Dundang of Parti Sarawak Bersatu (PSB).  He said GPS had shown itself to be a capable state government in the last five years in governing Sarawak, keeping the people united and bringing progress and prosperity.  The former State Disaster Management Committee also reminded all to observe the Covid-19 standard operating procedures (SOP) in place during the campaign period of the election.  'I will continue to remind my supporters while we are making all efforts in campaigning, we must always comply with the SOP. We do not want a similar situation as what had happened in Sabah, after its state polls in September, where there was a big surge in positive Covid-19 cases.  'As we can see in Melaka due to the high compliance, the state which had held its state election last month had not experienced any sudden increase,' he added."}
