{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Although every fan is entitled to his or her own opinions, those not on the field won't know what is actually happening during a match. That was stated by national Under-23 forward Azfar Fikri Azhar who stressed that players are the only ones feeling the pressure. Azfar said this after fans slammed the national team and FAM for their AFF Cup failure in Singapore last month. 'Not everyone understands football because on and off the field, it's different. They can say everything, but on the pitch, only the players know what is happening,' said Azfar. 'I have seen (online) what the fans said but I take everything positively.  'Let them say whatever they want. 'Our job is clear cut, respond with a win. If we win and emerge as champions, there won't be harsh criticism.' And Azfar hopes the fans will fully support and inspire the Malaysian team in the Asean Under-23 Championship in Phnom Penh, Cambodia from Feb 14-26. Though FAM have not called up core players Mukhairi Ajmal Mahadi, Harith Haiqal Adam Afkar, Sikh Izhan Nazrel Sikh Azman, Zikri Khalili, Luqman Hakim Shamsudin and Nik Akif Syahiran Nik Mat for the Asean mission, Azfar feels his team can still put up a good show. 'We can't just depend on them (core players) only. Don't tell me we can't win without them, we have plenty of quality players.' Azfar added that this is a chance for the players to prove themselves in Phnom Penh, and stake a strong claim for places in the Malaysian team to the Under-23 Asian Cup in Uzbekistan in June.  During last year's qualifiers, Azfar scored two goals, against Laos and Mongolia to help Malaysia emerge as group  champions and qualify for the competition proper."}
