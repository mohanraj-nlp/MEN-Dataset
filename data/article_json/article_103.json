Isa is a senator appointed to represent the Orang Asli community in Dewan Negara. All four candidates arrived at the nomination centre at Dewan Serbaguna Benut prior to the start of the nomination process which ran from 9am to 10am today. The Benut state seat returning officer is  Mohd Rafi Abdullah. During the 14th General Election, Hasni had won the seat after he garnered 9,480 votes as compared to PKR candidate Zulkifly Tasrep, who obtained 5,033 votes and Pas candidate Mohd Firdaus Jaafar who obtained 2,590 votes. Hasni won the seat with a 4,447-vote majority. The Election Commission has fixed the Johor election for March 12, with early voting set for March 8. On Jan 22, the Sultan of Johor Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar had consented to and signed the letter for the dissolution of the state assembly, which had paved the way for the state election. The Johor government had a thin majority of 28 seats against 27 seats held by the opposition block in the 56-seat legislature following the death of Kempas assemblyman Datuk Osman Sapian on Dec 21."}
