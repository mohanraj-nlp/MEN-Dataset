{"text": "SELANGOR  goal poacher Ifedayo Omosuyi relishes the competition from  Johor Darul Ta'zim's new hitman Bergson da Silva in the race for the Super League's Golden Boot.   The Nigerian-born striker, who was last season's top scorer in the Super League with 12 goals, said Bergson's eight goals in six matches will spur him to step up his game.   Omosuyi, who crossed paths with Bergson in a Super League clash which ended in a 1-1 draw at Sultan Ibrahim Stadium on March 17, admitted that the 30-year-old Brazilian is one of the best strikers he has seen.   He also picked Kedah's Liberian striker Kpah Sherman, who has scored five goals, as among the candidates for the Super League's top scorer crown this season.   'Bergson seems to be a top talent and he deserves credit. He's one of the league's top strikers apart from  Kedah's Sherman,' said Omosuyi, who has five goals under his belt this season.   'When there are players who are better than me, it spurs me to work harder.  'I'll be more motivated and push harder to get the goals for my team.   'I don't think too much about defending my top scorer crown. My target is to average a goal a match and help my team win matches.'   Last season, Omosuyi emerged as the M-League Golden Boots winner with 13 goals from 12 matches.    Last week, Omosuyi plundered a hat-trick to help Selangor beat Perak 3-1 at the MBPJ Stadium last week to put himself in second place in the scorers' chart, tied with Sherman on five goals.   The 1.80m Omosuyi admitted that the Red Giants have had a slow start to  the season but they are gathering momentum.   'We are getting better from match to match, and the win against Perak shows that the team have improved compared to the loss to Kedah.'"}
