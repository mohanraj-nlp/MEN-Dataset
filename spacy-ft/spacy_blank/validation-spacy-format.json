He said the company would operate seven hospitals with approximately 1,000 beds over the next five years and the first hospital in Rawang is expected to start operations early next year to serve the increased demand for high-quality healthcare services. 'As for the 150-bed hospital here, it is expected to be ready in 2025.

'We have allocated five acres of land for our first venture into healthcare and is a collaboration that will provide the first private specialise hospital in Balik Pulau.

He said the fact that state government did not make a public consultation before entering the agreement was questionable. The former chief minister also argued that the duration of the agreement for 100 years has resulted in up to two million hectares of Sabah's forests being handed over to Hock Standard Pte Ltd without due diligence. The Singapore-based company, which will benefit about 30 per cent of the trade deal profits, has never operated any business in the carbon credit industry.

Nevertheless, the company's property investment and management services segment recorded 18.9 per cent higher revenue of RM10.8 million in Q3 FY22 compared to RM9.1 million previously.

Meanwhile, for the nine month (9M) FY22, AME Elite's revenue and net profit amounted to RM258.7 million and RM27.7 million respectively, lower compared to the previous year's revenue of RM297.3 million and net profit of RM31.9 million, mainly due to restricted business activities and limited manpower capacity during the movement control orders. The restrictions caused delays in project completion and timing of projects in the company's property development, construction, and engineering services segments.
